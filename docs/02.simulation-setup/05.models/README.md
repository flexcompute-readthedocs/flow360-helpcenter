# Models in Flow360

This section covers the various models available in Flow360, organized into two main categories:

## [Boundary Conditions](./01.boundary-conditions/)

Boundary conditions define how the fluid interacts with the boundaries of the simulation domain. 
Flow360 provides a comprehensive set of boundary conditions including Wall, Freestream, Inflow, 
Outflow, Periodic, Symmetry, and Slip Wall conditions.

## [3D Models](./02.3d-models/)

3D models define the physical processes that occur within volumetric regions of the simulation domain, 
including core fluid models (Navier-Stokes Solver, Turbulence Model, Transition Model, Initial Condition) 
and special models (Rotation, BET Disk, Actuator Disk, Porous Medium).
