# Models in Flow360

This section covers the various models available in Flow360, organized into two main categories:

## Boundary Conditions 

Boundary conditions define how the fluid interacts with the boundaries of the simulation domain. 
Flow360 provides a comprehensive set of boundary conditions including:

- [Wall](./01.boundary-conditions/01.wall.md)
- [Freestream](./01.boundary-conditions/02.freestream.md)
- [Inflow](./01.boundary-conditions/03.inflow.md)
- [Outflow](./01.boundary-conditions/04.outflow.md)
- [Periodic](./01.boundary-conditions/05.periodic.md)
- [Symmetry](./01.boundary-conditions/06.symmetry.md)
- [Slip Wall](./01.boundary-conditions/07.slip-wall.md)
- [Turbulence Quantities](./01.boundary-conditions/08.turbulence-quantities.md)

## 3D Models

3D models define the physical processes that occur within volumetric regions of the simulation domain.
