# Boundary Layer Refinement

*Boundary layer refinement generates prismatic layers near wall surfaces to accurately resolve viscous effects and boundary layer phenomena, which is crucial for capturing wall shear stresses, heat transfer, and flow separation. The Boundary Layer refinement overwrites the general boundary layer settings set in [meshing defaults](../01.mesh.md).*

## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### **First Layer Thickness**

*Specifies the height of the initial prismatic layer adjacent to the wall.*

- **Required**
- **Example:** `1e-5 m`
- **Notes:** Critical for achieving desired y+ values and resolving viscous effects.

### **Assigned surfaces**

*Identifies the wall surfaces where boundary layer refinement will be applied.*

- **Required**
- **Notes:** Must reference valid wall surface entities in the geometry. Assign the boundaries by selecting from the list using the + button or select graphically in the viewer region.

- **How do I determine appropriate first layer thickness?**  
  > Calculate based on desired y+ value, Reynolds number, and flow conditions using appropriate scaling laws.

```python
from flow360 import BoundaryLayer, u

# Boundary layer refinement for wing
bl_ref = BoundaryLayer(
    name="wing_bl",
    faces=[wing_surface],
    first_layer_thickness=1e-5 * u.m,
)

# Boundary layer refinement for high Reynolds number flow
high_re_bl = BoundaryLayer(
    name="high_re_bl",
    faces=[high_re_surface],
    first_layer_thickness=1e-6 * u.m,  # Smaller for higher Reynolds number
)
