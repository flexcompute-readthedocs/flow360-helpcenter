# ⭕️ Rotation regions
*A set of Rotation cylinders. A rotation cylinder volume zone is designed specifically for regions containing rotating components. It ensures proper mesh refinement and enables accurate simulation of rotating machinery.*

## **Configuration Parameters**

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Spacing axial** | Mesh spacing along the cylinder's axis |
| **Spacing radial** | Mesh spacing in the radial direction |
| **Spacing circumferential** | Mesh spacing around the circumference |
| **Assigned cylinders** | Cylindrical components to which this zone applies |
| **Enclosed entities** | Additional geometric entities within the cylinder |


## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Spacing Axial**

Defines the mesh spacing along the cylinder axis.

- **Required**
- **Example:** `0.02 m`
- **Note:** Critical for capturing axial flow features and gradients.

### **Spacing Radial**

Specifies the mesh spacing in the radial direction.

- **Required**
- **Example:** `0.01 m`
- **Note:** Important for resolving radial flow patterns and boundary layer development.
  
### **Spacing Circumferential**

Controls the mesh spacing in the circumferential direction.

- **Required**
- **Example:** `0.015 m`
- **Note:** Essential for capturing rotational effects and circumferential variations.

### **Assigned cylinders**

Identifies the cylindrical regions where axisymmetric refinement will be applied.

- **Required**
- **Note:** Must reference valid cylinder entities in the geometry. Assign the cylinders by selecting from the list using the + button or select graphically in the viewer region.

### **Enclosed entities**

The bodies that the rottion region encloses.

- **Default:** None
- **Note:** Assign the entities by selecting from the list using the + button or select graphically in the viewer region. The bodies canot intersect with the rotation cylinder.

## **Key Features**

- Generates concentric mesh structure ideal for rotating components
- Can enclose other objects without intersecting them
- Supports donut-shaped configurations for stationary centerbody placement
- Compatible with Flow360's Rotation model

- Match spacing values to the expected flow features:
  - Use finer axial spacing in regions of strong axial gradients
  - Ensure adequate radial spacing for boundary layer resolution
  - Consider tip vortex resolution when setting circumferential spacing
- Keep computational efficiency in mind when setting spacing values
- Verify that assigned cylinders are properly aligned with rotation axes
- Ensure enclosed entities are fully contained within the rotation cylinder

- **What spacing values should I use for rotation cylinders?**
  > The spacing values depend on your specific case, but should be fine enough to capture boundary layers and wake effects around rotating components while considering computational resources.

- **Can I have multiple rotation cylinders?**
  > Yes, you can define multiple rotation cylinder zones with different spacing parameters for different components.

Below is a Python code example showing how to configure rotation regions using the Flow360 Python API:

```python
import flow360 as fl
from flow360 import u

# Example 1: Basic rotation cylinder configuration
rotation_zone = fl.RotationCylinder(
    spacing_axial=0.02 * u.m,
    spacing_circumferential=0.015 * u.m,
    spacing_radial=0.01 * u.m,
    entities=cylinder  # Reference to cylinder geometry entity
)
```
