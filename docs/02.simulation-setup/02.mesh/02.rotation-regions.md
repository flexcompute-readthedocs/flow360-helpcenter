# ⭕️ Rotation regions
*A set of Rotation cylinders. A rotation cylinder volume zone is designed specifically for regions containing rotating components. It ensures proper mesh refinement and enables accurate simulation of rotating machinery.*

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Spacing axial` | Mesh spacing along the cylinder's axis |
| `Spacing radial` | Mesh spacing in the radial direction |
| `Spacing circumferential` | Mesh spacing around the circumference |
| `Assigned cylinders` | Cylindrical components to which this zone applies |
| `Enclosed entities` | Additional geometric entities within the cylinder |

## Key Features

- Generates concentric mesh structure ideal for rotating components
- Can enclose other objects without intersecting them
- Supports donut-shaped configurations for stationary centerbody placement
- Compatible with Flow360's Rotation model

- Match spacing values to the expected flow features:
  - Use finer axial spacing in regions of strong axial gradients
  - Ensure adequate radial spacing for boundary layer resolution
  - Consider tip vortex resolution when setting circumferential spacing
- Keep computational efficiency in mind when setting spacing values
- Verify that assigned cylinders are properly aligned with rotation axes
- Ensure enclosed entities are fully contained within the rotation cylinder

- **What spacing values should I use for rotation cylinders?**
  > The spacing values depend on your specific case, but should be fine enough to capture boundary layers and wake effects around rotating components while considering computational resources.

- **Can I have multiple rotation cylinders?**
  > Yes, you can define multiple rotation cylinder zones with different spacing parameters for different components.
