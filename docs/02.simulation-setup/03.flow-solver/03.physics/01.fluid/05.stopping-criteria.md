# Stopping criteria

*Stopping criteria allow you to automatically terminate a simulation when monitored fields reach specified tolerance thresholds. The simulation stops when all configured criteria are satisfied simultaneously, providing efficient convergence control based on force coefficients, probe values, or surface probe data.*

## **How Stopping Criteria Work**

When you configure one or more stopping criteria:

1. **Field Computation**: The specified output field is computed from the selected output type. For Force Outputs, this includes force and moment coefficients (such as lift, drag, and pitching moment). For Probe Outputs, this includes flow variables at point locations (such as pressure, Mach number, or velocity). For Surface Probe Outputs, this includes flow variables projected onto surfaces (such as pressure coefficient or skin friction).

2. **Combined Criteria Evaluation**: The stopping condition is set to True if **either**:
   * All the user-defined stopping criteria are True. Meaning that for each criterion, the monitored field change becomes lower than the specified tolerance (if a tolerance window size is specified, the criterion evaluates the variation of the monitored field within that window; if no tolerance window size is specified, the criterion directly compares the latest value with the tolerance), **or**
   * Other solver settings are met (such as residual tolerance, maximum iterations, or time steps).

3. **Simulation Stop**: The simulation stops when **all** configured criteria are satisfied simultaneously.

> **Important:** All stopping criteria must be met at the same time for the simulation to stop. Each criterion is a combined condition that evaluates both the monitored field change tolerance and solver settings (such as residual tolerance, maximum iterations, or time steps). If you configure multiple criteria, the simulation will continue until every single criterion has reached its stopping condition.

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Name**

*A descriptive identifier for this stopping criterion.*

- **Default:** `"Criterion 1"`, `"Criterion 2"`, etc. (automatically assigned)
- **Example:** `"Lift convergence"`, `"Drag tolerance"`

### **Output type**

*Specifies the category of output that contains the field to be monitored.*

- **Default:** None
- **Options:**
  - `Force`: Monitor force and moment coefficients from force outputs
  - `Probe`: Monitor flow variables from probe outputs
  - `Surface Probe`: Monitor flow variables from surface probe outputs
> **Note:** The chosen output type must be configured in the [Output section](../../../04.output/README.md) of your simulation setup before it can be used here.

### **Output field**

*The specific scalar field within the selected output to monitor for convergence. The available fields depend on the output type: Force outputs provide force and moment coefficients, Probe outputs provide flow variables at point locations, and Surface Probe outputs provide flow variables on surfaces.*

- **Default:** None
- **Example:** `CD` (drag coefficient), `CL` (lift coefficient), `Cp` (pressure coefficient), `Mach` (Mach number)
> **Notes:**
> - The selected field must be one of the `output_fields` defined in the selected output instance.

### **Tolerance**

*Convergence threshold for the monitored field. The stopping criterion is set to True if the monitored field change becomes lower than this tolerance, or if other solver settings (such as residual tolerance, maximum iterations, or time steps) are met. If a **Tolerance window size** is specified, the criterion evaluates the variation of the monitored field within that window. If no tolerance window size is specified, the criterion directly compares the latest value with the tolerance.*

- **Default:** `0.01`
- **Example:** `1e-5`, `0.001`
> **Notes:**
> - This value is non-dimensional if the monitored field is a string-defined default field (e.g., `'CL'`, `'CD'`, `'Cp'`).

### **Tolerance window size**

*The number of data points from the monitor output used to check whether the variation of the monitored field within this window is below the tolerance. For steady simulations, this refers to the number of iterations. For unsteady simulations, this refers to the number of time steps. If not set, the criterion will directly compare the latest value with the tolerance.*

- **Default:** `100`
- **Example:** `50`, `200`
> **Notes:**
> - The value must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.
> - A larger window provides a more stable measure of convergence but may react slower to changes in the monitored field.

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **Do I need to configure outputs before using them in stopping criteria?**  
  > Yes, you must first configure the outputs (Force, Probe, or Surface Probe) in the [Output section](../../../04.output/README.md) with the appropriate output fields. Only outputs that are already defined can be selected in the stopping criteria configuration.

- **What happens if I configure multiple stopping criteria?**  
  > All stopping criteria must be satisfied simultaneously for the simulation to stop. Each criterion is a combined condition that evaluates both the monitored field change tolerance and solver settings (such as residual tolerance, maximum iterations, or time steps). If you configure multiple criteria, the simulation will continue until every single criterion has reached its stopping condition.

- **Can I use a field that's not in my output's output_fields list?**  
  > No, the selected field must be one of the `output_fields` defined in the selected output instance. Make sure to include the field you want to monitor when configuring the output.
