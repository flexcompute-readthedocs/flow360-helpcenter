# Slip Wall Boundary Condition

*The Slip Wall boundary condition allows flow to slip tangentially along a surface but not penetrate it, providing a frictionless boundary representation where shear stresses are zero.*

## 📋 **Available Options**

| *Option* | *Description* | *Applicable* |
|------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| **Assigned boundaries** | Geometric boundaries to apply the slip wall condition | always |

## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Assigned boundaries**

*Specifies the geometric boundaries to which the slip wall boundary condition is applied.*

- **Accepted types:** Surface, GhostSurface, GhostCircularPlane
- **Notes:** Can reference surfaces by name or pattern. Compatible with the `AutomatedFarfield` feature. The Slip Wall boundary condition enforces zero normal velocity at the boundary while allowing tangential flow with zero shear stress. Unlike a regular wall with the no-slip condition, a slip wall does not develop a boundary layer.

## **Key properties**

- Zero normal velocity (no flow through the boundary)
- Zero shear stress (tangential velocity can vary freely)
- No boundary layer formation
- No viscous effects at the wall

**Notes:** Unlike a moving wall, a slip wall has no defined velocity but allows tangential flow with zero friction.

### When to Use Slip Wall

- **Inviscid Flow Approximations:**
  - When viscous effects are negligible compared to pressure effects
  - For preliminary design studies where boundary layer details aren't important
  - When computational efficiency is prioritized over viscous accuracy

- **Specific Applications:**
  - Free surface approximations
  - Interface between different fluid domains
  - Ground plane approximation when boundary layer effects aren't important
  - Far-field boundaries in some cases

### Computational Benefits

- Requires less mesh resolution near the wall (no boundary layer to resolve)
- Can improve convergence for some flow problems
- Reduces computational cost compared to resolving viscous walls
- Allows for coarser meshes with larger y+ values at the wall

### Comparison with Other Boundary Types

- **Slip Wall vs. Regular Wall:**
  - Slip wall: Zero shear stress, no boundary layer
  - Regular wall: No-slip condition, develops boundary layer
  - Regular wall requires fine mesh resolution near surface
  
- **Slip Wall vs. Symmetry:**
  - Slip wall: Zero normal flow, zero shear stress
  - Symmetry: Zero normal flow, mirrored flow field
  - Symmetry enforces additional constraints on flow variables
  
- **Slip Wall vs. Moving Wall:**
  - Slip wall: No defined velocity, allows tangential flow with zero friction
  - Moving wall: Defined velocity, enforces no-slip condition at the specified velocity

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **When should I use a slip wall instead of a regular wall?**  
  > Use a slip wall when:
  > - Boundary layer effects are not important for your analysis
  > - You're performing preliminary design studies
  > - You're approximating inviscid flow
  > - You need to reduce computational cost and boundary layer resolution isn't critical

- **What's the difference between a slip wall and a symmetry boundary?**  
  > Both prevent flow crossing the boundary, but:
  > - Slip wall only enforces zero normal velocity and zero shear stress
  > - Symmetry enforces mirroring of all flow variables across the boundary
  > - Slip wall can be applied to any surface, while symmetry is only appropriate for actual planes of symmetry

- **How does a slip wall affect aerodynamic forces?**  
  > A slip wall:
  > - Will correctly capture pressure forces
  > - Will NOT capture any viscous/friction forces
  > - Will typically underestimate drag (sometimes significantly)
  > - May overestimate lift due to absence of boundary layer effects like separation

- **Do slip walls work with turbulence models?**  
  > Yes, but there's an important consideration:
  > - Turbulence models still operate in the flow field
  > - However, no turbulence is generated at the slip wall since there's no shear
  > - This creates an inconsistency if you're modeling a flow that should have wall-generated turbulence

- **Is a slip wall the same as an Euler wall?**  
  > Yes, a slip wall is sometimes called an Euler wall because it's consistent with Euler equations (inviscid flow equations). Both terms refer to a frictionless wall condition.

- **Can I mix slip walls and no-slip walls in the same simulation?**  
  > Yes, you can use slip walls for some boundaries and regular no-slip walls for others. This is common when some surfaces (like main bodies) need accurate viscous modeling while others (like far-field boundaries) don't.
