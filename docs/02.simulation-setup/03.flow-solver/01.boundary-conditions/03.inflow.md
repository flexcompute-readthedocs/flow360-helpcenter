# Inflow Boundary Condition

*The Inflow boundary condition specifies flow entering the computational domain, allowing you to define inlet conditions for internal flow simulations or when inlet conditions differ from the global freestream.*

## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Total Temperature**

*The stagnation (total) temperature of the flow at the inlet boundary.*

- **Default:** None (must be specified)
- **Example:** `300 K`
- **Notes:** This is the temperature the flow would have if brought to rest adiabatically.

### **Inflow Specification**

*Method used to specify the inflow conditions.*

- **Options:**
  - `Total Pressure`
  - `Mass Flow Rate`
- **Default:** None (one must be selected)
- **Notes:** Choose the method that best matches your known boundary conditions.

### **Total Pressure**

*The stagnation (total) pressure of the flow at the inlet boundary.*

- **Required when `Total Pressure` is selected.**
- **Example:** `101325 Pa`
- **Notes:** This is the pressure the flow would have if brought to rest isentropically.

### **Mass flow rate (value)**

*The mass flow rate through the inlet boundary.*

- **Required when `Mass Flow Rate` is selected.**
- **Example:** `10 kg/s`
- **Notes:** The solver will adjust the inlet velocity to achieve the specified mass flow rate.

### **Ramp steps**

*The number of pseudo time steps over which to gradually increase the mass flow rate to the specified value.*

- **Default:** `0` (full mass flow rate applied immediately)
- **Example:** `100`
- **Notes:** 
  - Only available when using Mass Flow Rate specification
  - Helps with simulation stability for high flow rates
  - The flow rate increases linearly from zero to the target value over the specified number of steps

### **Turbulence quantity**

*Optional specification of turbulence parameters at the boundary.*

- **Options:** Various parameter combinations
- **Default:** Uses global defaults based on turbulence model
- **Example:** `Turbulence Intensity = 0.05, Turbulent Length Scale = 0.01 m`
- **Notes:** 
  - Only specify at most two turbulence parameters
  - See [Turbulence Quantities documentation](./08.turbulence-quantities.md) for valid combinations and detailed explanations

### **Assigned boundaries**

*Specifies the geometric boundaries to which the inflow boundary condition is applied.*

- **Accepted types:** Surface
- **Notes:** Assign the boundaries by selecting from the list using the + button or select graphically in the viewer region.

### Choosing Inflow Specification Method

- **Total Pressure:** This specification is often best suited when:
  - You know the pressure at the inlet (e.g., atmospheric conditions).
  - Flow rate should be a calculated result rather than an input.
  - You are modeling external aerodynamics applications.
  
- **Mass Flow Rate:** This specification is often best suited when:
  - You know the precise flow rate (e.g., from a pump or fan).
  - You are modeling HVAC, engine inlets, or other applications with known flow rates.
  - You need to match experimental flow conditions.

### Inlet Placement

- Place inlets where flow conditions are known and relatively uniform
- Allow sufficient distance upstream of complex geometry (5-10 characteristic lengths)
- Avoid placing inlets immediately upstream of sharp turns or area changes

### Convergence Strategies

- Start with a lower mass flow rate and gradually increase it
- Monitor residuals and mass conservation to ensure proper convergence
- For challenging cases, first converge a simpler solution and then introduce the inlet

### Turbulence Specification

For recommendations on turbulence parameter values for various flow conditions, see the [Turbulence Quantities documentation](./08.turbulence-quantities.md).

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **Should I use Total Pressure or Mass Flow Rate specification?**  
  > Use Total Pressure when you know the driving pressure but not the exact flow rate. Use Mass Flow Rate when you need to ensure a specific flow rate regardless of the pressure required.

- **What happens if my inlet is too close to an obstacle?**  
  > Placing an inlet too close to obstacles can cause unrealistic flow patterns and convergence issues. Try to maintain at least 5 characteristic lengths of straight, uniform flow upstream of complex geometry.

- **How does the solver handle Mass Flow Rate specifications?**  
  > The solver adjusts the inlet velocity profile to achieve the specified mass flow rate while maintaining the specified total temperature and computed static pressure distribution.

- **What inlet turbulence values should I use?**  
  > For common internal flows:
  > - Fully developed pipe flow: Intensity ~5%, Length scale ~7% of diameter
  > - Flow from nozzles: Intensity 1-5%, Length scale based on nozzle dimensions
  > - HVAC ducts: Intensity 5-10%, Length scale based on hydraulic diameter

- **When should I use the Ramp Steps option? [python only]**  
  > Use Ramp Steps when:
  > - Simulating high flow rates that might cause initialization issues
  > - Encountering convergence problems with immediate application of the full flow rate
  > - Starting from an existing solution and significantly changing the flow conditions
