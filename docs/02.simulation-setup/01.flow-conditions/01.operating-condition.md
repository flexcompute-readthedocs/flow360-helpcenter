## **Detailed descriptions**

### **Type**

*Choose a method of defining the freestream velocity.*

### **Velocity magnitude**

*Define the freestream velocity using direct velocity magnitude.*

- **Required**
- **Example:** `100 m/s`
>**Note:** For hover or static conditions, you can set this to zero but must provide a reference velocity for coefficient calculations.

### **Reference velocity magnitude**

*Optional reference velocity used for calculating force and moment coefficients. Required when freestream velocity is zero.*

- **Default:** Same as **Velocity magnitude**
- **Example:** `100 m/s`
>**Note:** Particularly important for static/hover cases or when you want coefficients referenced to a different velocity than freestream.

### **Mach**

*Define the freestream Mach number.*

- **Required**
- **Example:** `0.8`
>**Note:** For hover or static conditions, you can set this to zero but must provide a reference velocity for coefficient calculations.

### **Reference Mach**

*Optional reference velocity used for calculating force and moment coefficients. Required when freestream velocity is zero.*

- **Default:** Same as **Mach**
- **Example:** `0.8`
>**Note:** Particularly important for static/hover cases or when you want coefficients referenced to a different velocity than freestream.

### **Alpha angle**

*The angle of attack defining the orientation of the freestream flow relative to the model. Positive values typically indicate nose-up orientation.*

- **Default:** `0 degrees`
- **Example:** `5 degrees`
>**Notes:** 
> - The angle is applied around the Y-axis of the global coordinate system.
> - Affects velocity components according to these formulas:
>   - $U_∞ = U_{mag} · cos(β) · cos(α)$
>   - $W_∞ = U_{mag} · cos(β) · sin(α)$
> - Where:
>   - $U_{mag}$ is the velocity magnitude prescribed by either Velocity Magnitude or Mach number
>   - $U_∞$ is the x-component of velocity in the global coordinate system
>   - $W_∞$ is the z-component of velocity in the global coordinate system

### **Beta angle**

*The sideslip angle defining the orientation of the freestream flow relative to the model. Positive values typically indicate flow from the right.*

- **Default:** `0 degrees`
- **Example:** `2 degrees`
>**Notes:** 
>  - The angle is applied around the Z-axis of the global coordinate system after alpha is applied.
>  - Affects velocity components according to these formulas:
>    - $U_∞ = U_{mag} · cos(β) · cos(α)$
>    - $V_∞ = -U_{mag} · sin(β)$
>    - $W_∞ = U_{mag} · cos(β) · sin(α)$
>  - Where:
>    - $U_{mag}$ is the velocity magnitude prescribed by either Velocity Magnitude or Mach number
>    - $U_∞$ is the x-component of velocity in the global coordinate system
>    - $V_∞$ is the y-component of velocity in the global coordinate system
>    - $W_∞$ is the z-component of velocity in the global coordinate system

### **Thermal state**

*Choose a method of defining the gas physical properties.*

>**Note:** Fluid material is fixed as Air in the GUI.

### **Density**

*Defines the fluid density.*

 - **Required**
 - **Example:** `1.0 kg/m³`

### **Temperature**

*Defines the fluid temperature.*

 - **Required**
 - **Example:** `250K`

### **Altitude**

*Defines the altitude for which the air properties are set according to the US Standard Atmosphere.*

 - **Required**
 - **Example:** `10000 m` 

### **Temperature offset**

*An offset from the temperature taken from the standard atmosphere.*

 - **Default:** `0 K`
 - **Example:** `-10 K`
>**Note:** If the altitude is set to `10000 m`, the temperature is `223.3 K` according to the US standard atmosphere. With the temperature offset of `-10 K`, the effective freestream temperature will be `213.3 K`.

### **Dynamic visosity**

*The dynamic viscosity of a liquid.*

 - **Required**
 - **Example:** `0.001002 Pa*s`

- For steady hover simulations, set freestream velocity to zero and provide a reference velocity.
- Use standard atmosphere for simulations that need realistic atmospheric conditions.
- When comparing with wind tunnel data, match Reynolds number by adjusting both velocity and thermal state.
- For low-speed simulations (M < 0.3), using a low Mach preconditioner is recommended for better efficiency.
- Reynolds number in the simulation is calculated using the mesh unit length, not necessarily a physical reference length.

<summary><h4 style="display:inline-block"> Advanced Mach and Reynolds Number Considerations</h4></summary>

- For transonic flows (0.8 < M < 1.2), use finer meshes near shock regions to capture discontinuities.
- When matching experimental data, ensure you're using the same reference values for non-dimensionalization.
- Remember that the Reynolds number affects boundary layer thickness—higher Reynolds numbers result in thinner boundary layers requiring finer near-wall mesh resolution.
- For simulations containing multiple components (e.g., many propellers), the same reference values will be used across all components.
- When using Standard Atmosphere, be aware that density decreases exponentially with altitude, which affects Reynolds number significantly.

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **What is the difference between velocity magnitude and reference velocity?**  
  > Velocity magnitude defines the actual freestream flow speed, while reference velocity is used for calculating non-dimensional coefficients. For most cases, they are the same, but for hover or special cases, you might want different values.

- **How is Reynolds number calculated in Flow360?**  
  > Reynolds number is calculated as Re = ρ·V·L/μ, where ρ is density, V is reference velocity, L is the reference length unit in the mesh, and μ is dynamic viscosity.

- **Can I simulate altitude effects?**  
  > Yes, by using the Standard Atmosphere option in Thermal State. This automatically sets temperature and density based on the specified altitude.

- **What happens if I leave Reference Velocity blank?**  
  > If freestream velocity is non-zero, the reference velocity defaults to the freestream value. If freestream velocity is zero, a reference velocity must be provided.

- **How do alpha and beta affect the simulation?**  
  > Rather than rotating the geometry, Flow360 adjusts the freestream flow direction based on alpha and beta using the formulas:
  > - U_∞ = U_mag · cos(β) · cos(α)
  > - V_∞ = -U_mag · sin(β)
  > - W_∞ = U_mag · cos(β) · sin(α)
  > 
  > Where U_mag is the velocity magnitude prescribed by either Velocity Magnitude or Mach number and U_∞, V_∞, and W_∞ represent the x, y, and z components of velocity in the global coordinate system, respectively. This simplifies comparing results at different angles without modifying the mesh.

- **Can I specify a different material other than Air?**  
  > In the GUI, only Air is available. For custom materials, you need to use the Python API.

Below is a Python code example showing how to configure operating conditions using the Flow360 Python API:

```python
import flow360 as fl
from flow360 import u

# Example 1: Setting up a condition with velocity magnitude
condition = fl.AerospaceCondition(
    velocity_magnitude=100 * u.m / u.s,
    alpha=5 * u.degree,
    beta=0 * u.degree,
    thermal_state=fl.ThermalState(
        temperature=288.15 * u.K,
        density=1.225 * u.kg / u.m**3
    )
)

# Example 2: Setting up a condition using from_mach with a reference Mach
condition = fl.AerospaceCondition.from_mach(
    mach=0.8,
    alpha=2 * u.degree,
    beta=1 * u.degree,
    thermal_state=fl.ThermalState(
        temperature=250 * u.K,
        density=0.9 * u.kg / u.m**3
    ),
    reference_mach=0.75  # For coefficient calculations
)

# Example 3: Setting up a hover condition (zero freestream) with reference values
hover_condition = fl.AerospaceCondition(
    velocity_magnitude=0 * u.m / u.s,
    alpha=0 * u.degree,
    beta=0 * u.degree,
    thermal_state=fl.ThermalState(
        temperature=288.15 * u.K,
        density=1.225 * u.kg / u.m**3
    ),
    reference_velocity_magnitude=100 * u.m / u.s  # Required for hover cases
)

# Example 4: Using standard atmosphere model for thermal state
condition = fl.AerospaceCondition(
    velocity_magnitude=200 * u.m / u.s,
    alpha=3 * u.degree,
    beta=0 * u.degree,
    thermal_state=fl.ThermalState.from_standard_atmosphere(
        altitude=10000 * u.m,
        temperature_offset=-5 * u.K
    )
)

# Example 5: Creating a condition from Mach and Reynolds number

condition = fl.AerospaceCondition.from_mach_reynolds(
    mach=0.85,
    reynolds=1e6,
    project_length_unit=1 * u.m,
    temperature=288.15 * u.K,
    alpha=2.0 * u.degree,
    beta=0.0 * u.degree,
    reference_mach=0.85
)

# Example 6: Calculating Reynolds number for an existing condition
project_length_unit = 1 * u.m  # Physical length represented by unit length in mesh
reynolds = condition.flow360_reynolds_number(length_unit=project_length_unit)
print(f"Reynolds number: {reynolds}")
