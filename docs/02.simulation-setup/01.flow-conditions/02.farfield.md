# Farfield 

*A farfield volume zone defines the outer boundaries of your computational domain. It establishes the limits where freestream conditions are applied and ensures proper flow development around your geometry.*

## **Available Options**
| *Option* | *Description*                 | *Applicable* |
|------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| **Type** | Method of constructing the farfield | always |
| **Method** | Method for determining farfield shape | **Type** is `Automated farfield` |

## **Detailed descriptions**

### **Type**

*Setting allowing the user to choose between generating the farfield in the workflow and providing the farfield as a part of uploaded geometry.*

**Possible selections:**
- `Automated farfield` - Farfield generated by Flow360 around the geometry
- `User defined farfield` - Farfield geometry provided by the user, has to be assigned to an appropriate boundary condition in [Boundary conditions](../03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/02.freestream.md)

### **Method**

*Method of defining the size of an auto-generated farfield.*

**Possible selections:**

- `Auto`: Automatically determines appropriate farfield dimensions based on geometry, 100 times the maximum dimensions of the geometry
  - Generates a full sphere if geometry extends across Y=0
  - Creates +Y semi-sphere if geometry is entirely above Y=0
  - Creates -Y semi-sphere if geometry is entirely below Y=0
- `Quasi-3D`: Creates a thin disk for quasi-3D simulations
  - Both sides of the farfield disk are treated as symmetric planes

- `Automated farfield` is generally preffered for aerospace applications
- Automotive applicatons and internal flows usually require the `User defined farfield` method

- **How do I choose between Auto and Quasi-3D farfield methods?**
  > Use Auto for full 3D simulations and Quasi-3D for 2D or axisymmetric cases where the flow is primarily in one plane.
