# Volume Output

Volume Output in Flow360 allows you to visualize flow field variables throughout the entire computational domain. This is essential for understanding 3D flow structures, vortex development, shockwaves, and other volumetric flow features.

## Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Volume Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Volume Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the output (defaults to "Volume output")
- **Output Format**: Choose between "paraview", "tecplot", or "both" (defaults to "paraview")
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to include in the output

### Animation Settings

- **Frequency**: How often to save outputs, in number of physical time steps (defaults to -1, which means only at the end of simulation)
- **Frequency Offset**: The time step at which to start the output animation (defaults to 0, beginning of simulation)

## Available Output Fields

## Key Output Fields for Flow Analysis

### Q-Criterion

The `qcriterion` field is extremely valuable for visualizing vortices in the flow field. To effectively use this field:

- Create isosurfaces of Q-criterion to identify vortical structures
- The default isosurface value is calculated as `RefMach² / (all walls' bounding box length)²`
- For aircraft simulations: a good starting value is approximately `Mach² / WingSpan²`
- For rotor flows: try `TipMach² / RotorDiameter²`
- Smaller values show more vortical structures but may clutter visualization
- Larger values show only the strongest vortices

> **Note**: Q-criterion can also be directly exported as an isosurface with a specific iso value using the [Isosurface Output](10.isosurface-output.md) feature, which provides better control over the visualization.

### BET Visualization

When using Blade Element Theory (BET) models for propellers or rotors, the `betMetrics` field provides valuable data for analyzing:

- Blade loading distributions
- Induced velocities
- Local angle of attack
- Flow conditions at each blade element

These metrics are essential for understanding propeller and rotor performance characteristics.

## Performance Considerations

Volume outputs can generate very large files, especially for fine meshes. Consider the following to manage file sizes:

1. Limit the frequency of volume outputs
2. Be selective about which fields to include
3. Use time-averaged volume outputs for statistical analysis of unsteady flows
4. Consider using slices or isosurfaces instead for targeted analysis

## Time-Averaged Volume Output

> **Note**: Time-averaged outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping.

For unsteady simulations, you can create time-averaged data for the volume by enabling the time-averaging option in the Output Settings panel. This generates time-averaged values of the selected output fields.

The **Start Step** setting controls when averaging begins (defaults to automatic detection). Time-averaged outputs provide statistical data that is useful for analyzing unsteady flow features.
