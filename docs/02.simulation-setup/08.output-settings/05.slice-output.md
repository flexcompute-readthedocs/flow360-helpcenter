# Slice Output

Slice Output in Flow360 allows you to visualize flow field variables on 2D cutting planes through the computational domain. This provides detailed insight into flow features at specific locations, while generating much smaller files than full volume outputs.

## Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Slice Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Slice Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the output (defaults to "Slice output")
- **Output Format**: Choose between "paraview", "tecplot", or "both" (defaults to "paraview")
- **Slices**: Define one or more slice planes by specifying their origin and normal vector
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to include in the output

### Animation Settings

- **Frequency**: How often to save outputs, in number of physical time steps (defaults to -1, which means only at the end of simulation)
- **Frequency Offset**: The time step at which to start the output animation (defaults to 0, beginning of simulation)

## Defining Slices

Each slice is defined by:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the slice
- **Origin**: The 3D coordinates of a point on the slice plane
- **Normal**: The normal vector to the slice plane (does not need to be normalized)

## Available Output Fields

Slice Output supports the same output fields as Volume Output:

## Key Output Fields for Slice Analysis

### Total Pressure Coefficient (Cpt)

The total pressure coefficient `Cpt` is especially useful for slice visualizations:

- Effectively shows boundary layer development and growth
- Clearly reveals flow separation regions 
- Highlights wakes behind objects
- Indicates regions of energy loss in the flow
- Can be used to identify vortices and other flow structures

To calculate the dimensional total pressure from Cpt:
```
p_t (N/m²) = Cpt × (1/2)ρ∞ × U_ref² + p_t∞
```

### Mach Number and Velocity Fields

These fields provide excellent visualization of:
- Shock waves
- Expansion regions
- Flow acceleration and deceleration zones
- Boundary layer thickness

## Common Slice Orientations

- **XY Plane**: Normal = (0, 0, 1)
- **YZ Plane**: Normal = (1, 0, 0)
- **XZ Plane**: Normal = (0, 1, 0)

## Strategic Slice Placement

Place slices at these key locations for maximum insight:

- **Leading and trailing edges** of aerodynamic surfaces
- **Maximum thickness** locations on wings or bodies
- **Wing-body junctions** to visualize corner flow
- **Wake regions** behind objects (at various downstream distances)
- **Boundary layer** regions (parallel to surface)
- **Shock wave** locations (approximately perpendicular to flow)

## Visualization Tips

- **For boundary layer analysis**: Use `Cpt` with a color scale that highlights low values
- **For shock detection**: Use `Mach` or `pressure` with carefully adjusted color scales
- **For vortex visualization**: Use `vorticityMagnitude` or velocity vector plots
- **For separation detection**: Look for reversal in velocity vectors or negative streamwise velocity
- **For BET analysis**: Position slices at specific radial positions of the rotor disk

## Time-Averaged Slice Output

> **Note**: Time-averaged outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping.

For unsteady simulations, you can create time-averaged data on slice planes by enabling the time-averaging option in the Output Settings panel. This generates time-averaged values of the selected output fields.

The **Start Step** setting controls when averaging begins (defaults to automatic detection). Time-averaged outputs provide statistical data that is useful for analyzing unsteady flow features.
