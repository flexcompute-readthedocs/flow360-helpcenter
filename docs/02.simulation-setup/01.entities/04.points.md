# Points

Points are used for monitoring and analyzing flow properties at specific locations in the simulation domain.

## Point

A Point entity represents a single monitoring location in three-dimensional space. It is primarily used with Probe output and Surface probe output to track flow properties at specific coordinates.

### Input Parameters

- **Name**: An identifier for the point (note: uniqueness is not enforced)
- **Position**: Three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) which can be specified in any length unit (e.g., meters, inches, etc.)

## PointArray

A PointArray entity defines multiple monitoring points distributed along a straight line. It creates an array of equally spaced points between a start and end location, inclusive of both endpoints.

### Input Parameters

- **Name**: An identifier for the point array (note: uniqueness is not enforced)
- **Start point position**: Three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) which can be specified in any length unit
- **End point position**: Three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) which can be specified in any length unit
- **Number of points**: Integer value greater than 2, specifying the total number of points along the line

## Applications

Points and PointArrays are particularly useful for:
- Monitoring flow variables at specific locations of interest
- Tracking time-dependent behavior at critical points in the flow field
- Extracting data for comparison with experimental measurements
- Analyzing wake characteristics or boundary layer profiles
- Creating line plots of flow properties along a defined path
- Locating positions of certain components during pre-processing

## Usage Guidelines

When defining points for monitoring, consider the following:
- Place points in regions where significant flow phenomena are expected
- Use PointArrays to capture gradients or transitions in the flow field
- Ensure points are positioned within the computational domain
- For boundary layer analysis, create points or arrays perpendicular to surfaces
- Use meaningful naming conventions to easily identify point locations

## Output Data

Points can output various flow field variables including:
- Pressure
- Temperature
- Velocity components
- Density
- Turbulence quantities
- Vorticity
- Other solver-specific variables
