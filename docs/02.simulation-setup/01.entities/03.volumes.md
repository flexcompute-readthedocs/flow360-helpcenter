# Volumes

Volume entities in Flow360 are used to set up [volume zones](./../02.meshing/02.volume-zone.md), [local refinements](./../02.meshing/03.refinements.md) and [3D models](./../05.models/02.3d-model.md).

## 📝 **Volume Primitives**

*Flow360 provides two primary volume primitives: boxes and cylinders. These primitives can be used individually or combined to create complex geometric configurations.*

---

### Box

A box is a rectangular prism defined by its center point and size (dimensions). Boxes can be oriented in three-dimensional space using one of two transformation methods.

#### 📋 **Box Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Name` | Unique identifier for the box | |
| `Center` | Three-dimensional coordinates defining the center point | length (e.g., m) |
| `Size` | Three-dimensional dimensions (length, width, height) | length (e.g., m) |

#### 📋 **Box Orientation Methods**

#### Method 1: Principal Axes

*Defines the box orientation using two orthogonal vectors. This method provides direct control over the box's principal directions.*

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Axes` | Two orthogonal vectors defining principal directions | dimensionless |

>**Notes**: 
- Axes must be orthogonal vectors
- First axis defines the primary direction
- Second axis defines the secondary direction
- Third axis is automatically computed to complete the right-handed coordinate system

#### Method 2: Axis & Angle

*Defines the box orientation using a rotation axis and angle. This method is useful when you need to rotate the box around a specific axis.*

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Rotation Axis` | Normalized vector for rotation | dimensionless |
| `Rotation Angle` | Angle of rotation around the specified axis | degrees |

>**Notes**:
- Rotation axis must be a normalized vector
- Rotation angle is in degrees
- Positive angle follows right-hand rule around the rotation axis

### Cylinder

A cylinder is a three-dimensional geometric shape with a circular or oval cross-section.

#### 📋 **Cylinder Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Name` | Unique identifier for the cylinder | |
| `Center` | Three-dimensional coordinates defining the center point | length (e.g., m) |
| `Axis` | Normalized vector defining cylinder direction | dimensionless |
| `Radius` | Distance from central axis to outer surface | length (e.g., m) |
| `Inner Radius` | Distance from central axis to inner surface | length (e.g., m) |
| `Height` | Length along central axis | length (e.g., m) |

?**Notes**: 
- The cylinder axis defines the direction of the cylinder
- Inner radius defaults to 0 for a full cylinder
- Height is measured along the cylinder's central axis
- Axis must be a normalized vector

## 💡 **Tips**

### When to Use Each Volume Type
- **Box**: 
  - For rectangular or square regions
  - For creating structured refinement zones
- **Cylinder**:
  - For circular or cylindrical regions
  - When modeling propulsors or rotating machinery
  - For creating radial refinement patterns

### Common Applications
- **Volume Zones**: Defining regions for specific material properties or flow conditions
- **Local Refinements**: Creating areas of increased mesh resolution

### Implementation Tips
- Ensure volumes don't overlap unless specifically intended
- Use appropriate dimensions relative to your simulation scale
- Consider the impact of volume orientation on mesh generation

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **Can volumes overlap?**  
  > Yes, volumes can overlap, but this should be done intentionally as it may affect mesh generation and simulation results.

- **How do I create a hollow cylinder?**  
  > Set the inner radius parameter to a value greater than 0 and less than the outer radius.

- **What happens if I don't specify orientation for a box?**  
  > The box will align with the global coordinate system axes.

- **Can I use volumes for boundary conditions?**  
  > No, volumes are used for defining regions within the domain, not for boundary conditions.

- **How do I create a complex shape?**  
  > Combine multiple volumes using boolean operations or by positioning them appropriately.

## Visibility

Volume visibility can be toggled on/off by clicking on the eye icon that appears next to it when you hover your cursor over the entity or have it selected.

## Python API Usage Example

Below is an example of how to create volumes using the Flow360 Python API:

```python
# Example (for reference only, not included in GUI documentation)
box = fl.Box(
    name="my_box",
    center=(0, 0, 0) * fl.u.m,
    size=(1, 1, 1) * fl.u.m,
    axes=((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0))
)

cylinder = fl.Cylinder(
    name="my_cylinder",
    center=(0, 0, 0) * fl.u.m,
    axis=(0, 1, 0),
    outer_radius=1.0 * fl.u.m,
    height=2.0 * fl.u.m
)
```
