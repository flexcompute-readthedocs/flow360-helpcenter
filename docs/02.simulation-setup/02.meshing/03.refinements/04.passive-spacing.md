# Passive Spacing

*Passive spacing provides indirect control over mesh behavior without explicit refinement specification, enabling smooth transitions between different mesh regions and maintaining mesh continuity across interfaces.*

### 🔍 Detailed Descriptions

#### Type

Specifies the methodology for spacing control.

- **Default:** None (required)
- **Available Options:** 
  - `projected`: Projects spacing from adjacent volumes
  - `unchanged`: Preserves existing surface mesh
- **Notes:** Selection determines how mesh spacing is controlled

#### Assigned surfaces

Identifies the surfaces where spacing control will be applied.

- **Default:** None (required)
- **Example:** `[interface_surface, transition_surface]`
- **Notes:** Must reference valid surface entities in the geometry

- Use projected spacing for interface regions between different mesh zones
- Apply unchanged spacing where surface mesh quality is already optimal
- Consider geometric complexity when selecting spacing type
- Ensure compatibility with adjacent refinement regions
- Balance mesh quality with computational efficiency

- **When should I use projected vs. unchanged spacing?**  
  > Use projected for interface regions requiring smooth transitions, and unchanged when existing surface mesh quality is satisfactory.

- **How does passive spacing interact with other refinements?**  
  > Passive spacing operates independently of other refinements, focusing on maintaining mesh continuity and quality.

```python
from flow360 import PassiveSpacing

# Projected spacing for interface region
interface_spacing = PassiveSpacing(
    name="interface_region",
    refinement_type="projected",
    faces=[interface_surface]
)

# Unchanged spacing for optimized surface
preserved_spacing = PassiveSpacing(
    name="optimized_surface",
    refinement_type="unchanged",
    faces=[optimized_surface]
