# Time-averaging Streamline Output

*Time-averaging Streamline Output in Flow360 allows you to visualize time-averaged streamlines during unsteady simulations. Streamtraces are computed upwind and downwind, and may originate from a single point, from a line, or from points evenly distributed across a parallelogram.*

> **Note**: Time-averaging outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping methods.

## **Available Options**

| *Option* | *Description* |
|----------|---------------|
| **Output fields** | Flow variables to include along streamlines |
| **Start step** | Physical time step to start calculating averaging |
| **Assigned points** | Points indicating the locations of streamlines |

---

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Output fields**

*The flow variables that will be included along the time-averaged streamlines.*

- **Default:** None
- **Example:** `pressure`, `velocity`, `Mach`
>**Note:** Vector-valued fields will be colored by their magnitude. See [Available Output Fields](./00.output-fields.md) for a complete list of supported variables.

### **Start step**

*The physical time step at which time-averaging begins.*

- **Required:** Yes
- **Default:** None
- **Example:** `100` (begin averaging from the 100th physical time step)
>**Notes:** 
> - Use positive integers to start averaging from a specific time step.
> - Set this to a time step after initial transients have settled for more meaningful statistics.
> - Important for child cases - this parameter refers to the **global** time step, which gets transferred from the parent case. See [Global Time Stepping in Child Cases](06.time-averaging-slice-output.md#global-time-stepping-in-child-cases) for more details.

### **Assigned points**

*Points that define the placement of streamlines. Streamtraces are computed upwind and downwind, and may originate from a single point, from a line, or from points evenly distributed across a parallelogram.*

- **Point Definition:** The creation of points is described in detail [here](../../../01.introduction/03.workbench-layout/06.entities-browser/05.points.md)
  
>**Notes:** 
> - You can specify individual points or arrays of points to seed streamlines at multiple locations. 
> - Points can be defined in the GUI or via the Python API.
