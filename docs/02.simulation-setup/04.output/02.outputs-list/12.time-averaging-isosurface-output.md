# Time-averaging Isosurface Output

*Time-averaged Isosurface Output in Flow360 lets you visualize the time-averaged flow field variables on surfaces of constant value within the computational domain. This is particularly useful for identifying and analyzing average flow structures like vortices, shock waves, or temperature contours.*

> **Note**: Time-averaging outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping.

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Output fields**

*Select the flow variables to include in the isosurface output.*

- **Default:** None
- **Example:** `Mach, pressure, velocity`
>**Note:** See detailed field descriptions below. Only select fields you need to analyze.

### **Output format**

*The file format used to save the isosurface output data.*

- **Default:** `paraview`
- **Example:** `both`
- **Options:**
  - `paraview`
  - `tecplot`
  - `both`
> **Notes:** 
> - Choose the format that best suits your post-processing workflow.
> - Select `paraview` for `.vtu` format, `tecplot` for `.plt` format, or `both` to save in both formats.

### **Start step**

*The physical time step at which time-averaging begins.*

- **Default:** `-1` (at end of simulation)
- **Example:** `100` (begin averaging from the 100th physical time step)
>**Note:** Use positive integers to start averaging from a specific time step.

### **Save interval**

*Choose the points in the simulation where the results are saved.*

- **Default:** `Save at end`
- **Options:**
  - `Save at end`
  - `Custom`
> **Notes:** 
> - Choose `Save at end` to save only the final results of the simulation.
> - Choose `Custom` to save the results in given intervals.

### **Frequency**

*How often to save outputs, in number of physical time steps.*

- **Default:** `-1` (only at the end of simulation)
- **Example:** `100`
>**Note:** Higher frequencies provide better temporal resolution but increase storage requirements.

### **Frequency offset**

*The time step at which to start the output animation.*

- **Default:** `0` (beginning of simulation)
- **Example:** `1000`
>**Note:** Useful when you want to skip initial transient flow development.

### **Assigned isosurfaces**

*Define one or more isosurfaces by specifying a field variable and iso-value.*

- **Default:** None
- **Definition parameters:**
  - **Name:** A unique identifier for the isosurface
  - **Field:** The flow variable used to define the isosurface
  - **Iso-value:** The constant value of the field variable that defines the isosurface
- **Example:** `qcriterion = 0.001`

#### When to Use Time-Averaged Outputs

- Use time averaging when you need statistical flow behavior rather than instantaneous snapshots
- Particularly useful for unsteady flows with periodic or chaotic behavior
- Effective for filtering out noise and revealing underlying flow patterns

#### Selecting the Right Start Step

- Set Start Step after initial transients have passed for more meaningful averages
- Monitor convergence of your unsteady simulation to determine appropriate Start Step
- Too early: averages may include non-physical startup transients
- Too late: may miss important physical phenomena

#### Setting Appropriate Frequency

- For long simulations, use higher Frequency values to reduce storage requirements
- For detailed time evolution of averages, use lower Frequency values
- Balance between data resolution and file size

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **When should I use time-averaged outputs instead of regular outputs?**  
  > Time-averaged outputs are ideal for unsteady simulations where you want to analyze the statistical behavior of the flow rather than instantaneous values. They help filter out noise and reveal underlying flow patterns.

- **Can I have both time-averaged and instantaneous outputs for the same isosurface?**  
  > Yes, you can define both regular isosurface outputs and time-averaged isosurface outputs for the same points to monitor both instantaneous and time-averaged values.

- **How does the averaging calculation work?**  
  > Flow360 calculates a running average from the Start Step specified until the end of the simulation. The average is computed and saved at the frequency specified.

- **Does time-averaging increase computational cost?**  
  > Time-averaging adds minimal computational overhead as it's primarily a post-processing operation, but it does require additional memory to store the averaged values.

- **What happens if I set Start Step to -1?**  
  > Setting Start Step to -1 means the time-averaged output will only be calculated and saved at the end of the simulation, providing a single averaged value over the entire simulation (after any specified start step).

- **Can I use time-averaging with steady simulations?**  
  > No, time-averaged outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping methods, as they require time evolution to calculate meaningful averages.
