# Time-averaging Surface Output

*Time-averaging Surface Output in Flow360 allows you to collect statistical data for unsteady simulations, providing time-averaged values of flow field variables on geometry surfaces. This is essential for analyzing periodic or turbulent flows where instantaneous values may fluctuate significantly.*

> **Note**: Time-averaging outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping methods.

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Output fields**

*The flow variables that will be time-averaged in the output files.*

- **Example:** `Cp`, `velocity`, `pressure`
>**Note:** Time-averaging is applied to each selected field independently.

### **Output format**

*Specifies the file format for the output files.*

- **Default:** `paraview`
- **Options:**
  - `paraview`
  - `tecplot`
  - `both`
> **Notes:** 
> - Choose the format that best suits your post-processing workflow.
> - Select `paraview` for `.vtu` format, `tecplot` for `.plt` format, or `both` to save in both formats.

### **Start step**

*Specifies the time step at which to begin the time-averaging process.*

- **Default:** `-1` (at end of simulation)
- **Example:** `5000` (start averaging at time step 5000)
>**Note:** Set this to a time step after initial transients have settled for more meaningful statistics.

### **Write single file**

*Controls whether all surface outputs are written to a single file instead of one file per surface.*

- **Default:** `false`
- **Options:**
  - `true`
  - `false`
>**Note:** This option currently only supports Tecplot output format.

### **Save interval**

*Choos the points in the simulaton where the results are saved.*

- **Default:** `Save at end`
- **Options:**
  - `Save at end`
  - `Custom`
> **Notes:** 
> - Choose `Save at end` to save only the final results of the simulation.
> - Choose `Custom` to save the results in given intervals.

### **Frequency**

*Controls how often the time-averaged output files are generated.*

- **Default:** `-1` (only at end of simulation)
- **Example:** `100` (save time-averaged output every 100 time steps)
>**Note:** Setting to `-1` will only produce output at the end of the simulation.

### **Frequency offset**

*Specifies the time step at which to begin saving the time-averaged output.*

- **Default:** `0` (at beginning of simulation)
- **Example:** `1000` (start saving output at time step 1000)
>**Note:** This setting works in conjunction with `Frequency` to control the time steps at which output is produced.

### **Assigned boundaries**

*The geometry surfaces where time-averaging will be applied.*

- **Example:** `wing`, `fuselage`, `all_walls`
>**Note:** You can specify individual surfaces or use pattern matching (e.g., `"wall*"`) to select multiple surfaces.

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> 💡 Tips</h3></summary>

- **Averaging window:** Ensure your simulation runs long enough after the `Start Step` to collect meaningful statistics
- **Transient effects:** Set `Start Step` beyond the initial transient period
- **Periodic flows:** For flows with known periodicity, average over multiple complete cycles
- **Flow stability:** Monitor convergence of time-averaged quantities to ensure statistical stability

#### When visualizing time-averaged surface output, consider:
- Comparing time-averaged and instantaneous fields to identify regions of high unsteadiness
- Using time-averaged fields to calculate stable performance metrics
- Examining the difference between time-averaged and steady-state solutions for similar conditions
- Creating streamlines based on time-averaged velocity fields to reveal mean flow patterns

- **How is time-averaging calculated?**  
  > Time-averaging is calculated using a running average formula:
  > 
  > ```
  > avg_new = avg_old + (new_value - avg_old) / n
  > ```
  > 
  > Where:
  > - `avg_new` is the updated time-average
  > - `avg_old` is the previous time-average
  > - `new_value` is the instantaneous value at the current time step
  > - `n` is the number of samples since the start of averaging

- **What's the difference between time-averaging and animation?**  
  > - **Animation:** Captures instantaneous "snapshots" of the flow at specific time steps (controlled by `Frequency`)
  > - **Time-averaging:** Produces statistical averages over many time steps, reducing noise and revealing mean flow patterns

- **When should I use time-averaging?**  
  > Time-averaging is particularly useful for:
  > 
  > - Turbulent flows where instantaneous values fluctuate significantly
  > - Periodic flows where cycle-to-cycle statistics are of interest
  > - Calculating mean aerodynamic performance metrics in unsteady simulations
  > - Identifying quasi-steady flow features in dynamically changing simulations
