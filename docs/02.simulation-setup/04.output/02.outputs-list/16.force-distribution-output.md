# Force Distribution Output

*Force Distribution Output allows you to compute and output force and moment distributions along a custom direction. This is useful for analyzing spanwise loading on wings, chordwise force distributions, or any other directional force analysis that doesn't align with the standard coordinate axes.*

---

## **Available Options**

| *Option* | *Description* | *Applicable* |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Name** | Unique identifier for the force distribution output | always |
| **Distribution direction** | 3D unit vector specifying the direction along which forces and moments are distributed | always |
| **Distribution type** | Type of distribution calculation: incremental or cumulative | always |

---

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Name**

*Unique identifier for the force distribution output.*

- **Required:** Yes
- **Example:** `"spanwise"`, `"chordwise"`
>**Note:** Output names must be unique among all force distribution outputs in the same simulation.

### **Distribution direction**

*The 3D unit vector that specifies the direction along which forces and moments are distributed. The vector is automatically normalized by Flow360.*

- **Required:** Yes
- **Format:** 3-element array `[x, y, z]` representing a 3D direction vector
- **Example:** `[0, 1, 0]` for spanwise (y-direction), `[1, 0, 0]` for chordwise (x-direction), `[0.1, 0.9, 0]` for a custom oblique direction
>**Note:** The vector is automatically normalized, so `[0.1, 0.9, 0]` and `[0.1, 0.9, 0.0]` will result in the same normalized direction vector.

### **Distribution type**

*Specifies whether forces and moments are output as incremental (per segment) or cumulative (integrated up to that point).*

- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `"incremental"`
- **Options:**
  - `"incremental"` - Outputs force and moment contributions for each segment along the distribution direction
  - `"cumulative"` - Outputs the cumulative (integrated) force and moment values along the distribution direction

## **Use Cases**

Force Distribution Output is useful for:

- Analyzing spanwise loading distributions on wings or propellers
- Computing chordwise force distributions
- Custom directional force analysis (e.g., forces along a sweep direction)
- Identifying critical loading regions along specific geometric directions
- Comparing force distributions between different components or configurations

## **Output Data**

The output provides axis-aligned components of force and moment coefficients along the specified distribution direction. Data is saved in CSV format and can be accessed through:

- **Python API**: Results are available through `case.results` (pattern: `<output_name>_forceDistribution.csv`)
- **WebUI**: Download from the **Assets** button

The output includes force and moment coefficients (CL, CD, CFx, CFy, CFz, CMx, CMy, CMz) distributed along the specified direction.

#### Basic Force Distribution Output Example

```python
import flow360 as fl

# Create a spanwise force distribution (along y-axis)
spanwise_distribution = fl.ForceDistributionOutput(
    name="spanwise",
    distribution_direction=[0, 1, 0],  # Y-direction
    distribution_type="cumulative"
)
```
