## **Available Parameters**

| *Parameter* | *Description* |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Moment reference center** | Point coordinates defining the reference location for moment calculations |
| **Moment length** | Reference dimensions used for non-dimensionalization of moment coefficients |
| **Area** | Reference area used for non-dimensionalization of force and moment coefficients |

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Moment reference center**

*The moment reference center specifies the point about which aerodynamic moments are computed. This point is typically located at a significant position on the aircraft, such as the center of gravity or a specific percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord.*

- **Default:** `(0, 0, 0) m`
- **Example:** `(0.25, 0.0, 0.0) m`
>**Note:** The coordinate system follows the right-hand rule convention.

### **Moment length**

*Reference lengths used in the calculation of non-dimensional moment coefficients. These values are typically related to the characteristic dimensions of the geometry.*

- **Default:** `(1, 1, 1) m`
- **Example:** `(1.0, 5.0, 1.0) m`
>**Note:** Each component corresponds to the respective axis of rotation.

### **Area**

*The reference area is used to non-dimensionalize force and moment coefficients. For aircraft applications, this is typically the wing planform area, whereas for automotive cases it would be the frontal area of the car.*

- **Default:** `1 m²`
- **Example:** `10.0 m²`
>**Note:** Must be a positive non-zero value.

- The moment reference center location significantly impacts moment coefficient calculations.
- For aircraft analysis:
  - Reference area is typically the wing planform area
  - Moment reference center is often at 25% of the mean aerodynamic chord
  - Longitudinal (roll) moment length is usually the wingspan
  - Lateral (pitch) moment length is typically the mean aerodynamic chord
  - Vertical (yaw) moment length is often the mean aerodynamic chord
- For automotive analysis:
  - Reference area is typically the frontal area of the vehicle
  - Moment reference center is often at the center of the wheelbase at ground level
  - Longitudinal moment length is usually the wheelbase
  - Lateral moment length is typically the track width
  - Vertical moment length is commonly the vehicle height

- **How do reference geometry parameters affect coefficient calculations?**  
  > These parameters are used to non-dimensionalize forces and moments into coefficient form. The reference area is used for all coefficient calculations, while moment lengths are used specifically for moment coefficients.

- **What happens if I use incorrect reference values?**  
  > Using incorrect reference values will result in incorrectly scaled coefficients, making it difficult to compare results with other simulations or experimental data.

- **Can I change reference values between simulations?**  
  > Yes, but ensure you account for the changes when comparing results between different simulations.
