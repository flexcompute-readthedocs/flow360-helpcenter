#### Key Surface Output Fields for Analysis

**Pressure Coefficient (Cp)**

The pressure coefficient is one of the most important surface fields for analyzing aerodynamic performance:

- It shows the distribution of pressure on the surface relative to freestream conditions
- Negative values indicate suction (lower than freestream pressure)
- Positive values indicate pressure (higher than freestream pressure)
- For aircraft analysis, compare upper and lower surface Cp to understand lift generation
- Rapid changes in Cp can indicate shock waves or separation points

To calculate the dimensional pressure from Cp:
```
p (N/m²) = Cp × (1/2)ρ∞ × U_ref² + p∞
```

**Skin Friction Coefficient (Cf, CfVec)**

The skin friction coefficient is critical for analyzing boundary layer behavior:

- `CfVec` provides both magnitude and direction of skin friction
- `Cf` gives only the magnitude
- Useful for identifying:
  - Regions of high skin friction (and thus drag)
  - Boundary layer separation points
  - Flow reversal areas

Visualization techniques:
- Color surface by the streamwise component of `CfVec` (e.g., `CfVecX` for flow primarily in the x-direction)
- Use a 3-level color scale centered at zero to easily identify attached flow (positive values) and separated flow (negative values)
- Create surface streamlines based on the `CfVec` field instead of velocity to visualize surface flow patterns

For dimensional wall shear stress, use the `wall_shear_stress_magnitude_pa` field which provides values directly in Pascals (N/m²), eliminating the need for manual conversion. This feature is available since Flow360 version 25.2.

**Node Forces Per Unit Area**

The `nodeForcesPerUnitArea` field represents the force (pressure + friction) applied at each surface node divided by the surface area attributed to that node. This field is particularly useful for:

- Calculating sectional loading values
- Analyzing pressure and shear force distribution
- Identifying areas of high loading

When integrated over the entire surface, this field equals the total forces acting on the surface.

#### Visualization Tips

- **For pressure analysis**: Use `Cp` with a consistent color scale across different configurations for valid comparisons
- **For boundary layer analysis**: Use `CfVec` components and `yPlus` together
- **For separation detection**: Create surface streamlines using `CfVec` or look for negative streamwise component values
- **For heat transfer analysis**: Use `heatFlux` and heat transfer coefficient fields

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

**How do I visualize only specific surfaces in my output?**  
> Use the `entities` parameter (alias: `surfaces`) to specify exactly which surfaces you want to include. You can use both specific surface names or pattern matching:
>
> ```python
> # Specific surfaces
> fl.SurfaceOutput(
>     entities=[volume_mesh["wing_left"], volume_mesh["wing_right"]]
> )
>
> # Pattern matching for all wing surfaces
> fl.SurfaceOutput(
>     entities=[volume_mesh["wing*"]]
> )
> ```
>
> In the GUI, select the specific surfaces from the boundary list.

**What's the difference between non-dimensional and dimensional output fields?**  
> - **Non-dimensional fields** (e.g., `Cp`, `Mach`, `velocity`) are normalized using reference values and are useful for comparing different simulations.
>   
> - **Dimensional fields** (e.g., `pressure_pa`, `velocity_m_per_s`) provide results in physical units, making it easier to compare with experimental data or understand absolute magnitudes.
>
> For convenience, we recommend using dimensional fields when absolute values are important. For example, `pressure_pa` provides pressure directly in Pascals rather than requiring manual conversion from `Cp`.

**How do I reduce the size of my output files?**  
> Large output files can be unwieldy. To reduce their size:
>
> 1. **Limit output frequency**: Use larger values for `frequency` to save outputs less often
> 2. **Select only necessary fields**: Choose only the specific fields needed for your analysis
> 3. **Limit surface selection**: Include only surfaces relevant to your analysis
> 4. **Use time-averaged outputs**: For unsteady simulations, consider using time-averaged outputs instead of saving every timestep

**How can I detect flow separation on surfaces?**  
> Flow separation can be detected using:
>
> 1. **Skin friction vector (`CfVec`)**: Separation occurs where the streamwise component becomes negative
> 2. **Surface streamlines**: Use ParaView to create streamlines from the `CfVec` field to visualize separation patterns
> 3. **Pressure coefficient (`Cp`)**: Look for plateau regions or sudden changes in the pressure distribution
>
> For detailed separation analysis, create a color map of the streamwise component of `CfVec` with a 3-level scale (blue for negative/separation, white for zero, red for positive/attached flow).

**Can I output surface data at specific physical times instead of iterations?**  
> The `frequency` parameter refers to iteration counts, not physical time. For time-accurate simulations:
>
> 1. Calculate the number of iterations corresponding to your desired physical time interval
> 2. Set the `frequency` parameter accordingly
> 3. For a more direct approach, you can use a monitor point to trigger a custom output at specific physical times using a script that interacts with the Flow360 API

#### Basic Surface Output

The following example shows how to set up surface output to visualize pressure and skin friction on aircraft wings:

```python
# Define a surface output for all wing surfaces
wing_output = fl.SurfaceOutput(
    name="Wing Surface Analysis",                      # Descriptive name
    entities=[volume_mesh["wing*"]],                   # All surfaces matching "wing*" pattern 
    output_format="paraview",                          # Output in ParaView (.vtu) format
    output_fields=["Cp", "Cf", "Mach", "pressure_pa"], # Include both non-dim and dimensional fields
    frequency=100,                                     # Save every 100 steps
    frequency_offset=0                                 # Start from beginning
)

# Define a body surface output with less frequent saving
body_output = fl.SurfaceOutput(
    name="Body Surface Analysis",
    entities=[volume_mesh["fuselage"], volume_mesh["nacelles"]],  
    output_format="both",                              # Save in both ParaView and Tecplot formats
    output_fields=["Cp", "yPlus", "wallDistance"],     # Fields for boundary layer analysis
    frequency=500,                                     # Save less frequently
    write_single_file=True                             # Write all surfaces to a single file (Tecplot only)
)

# Include in simulation parameters
simulation_params = fl.SimulationParams(
    # ... other parameters ...
    outputs=[wing_output, body_output]
)

# Submit through project interface
project.submit_simulation(simulation_params)
```

#### Time-Averaged Surface Output

For unsteady simulations where time-averaged results are important:

```python
# Define time-averaged surface output
avg_surface_output = fl.TimeAverageSurfaceOutput(
    name="Time-Averaged Wing Analysis",
    entities=[volume_mesh["wing*"]],  
    output_format="paraview",
    output_fields=["Cp", "CfVec", "nodeForcesPerUnitArea"],
    start_step=1000,                  # Start averaging from step 1000
    frequency=500,                    # Output averaged results every 500 steps
    frequency_offset=1500             # Start saving outputs at step 1500
)

# Include in simulation parameters 
simulation_params = fl.SimulationParams(
    # ... other parameters ...
    outputs=[avg_surface_output]
)
```

#### Custom Surface Output with User-Defined Field

Creating a custom output field and using it in surface output:

```python
# Define a custom output field
custom_field = fl.UserDefinedField(
    name="PressureForce",
    expression="double prel = primitiveVars[4] - pressureFreestream; "
               + "PressureForce[0] = prel * nodeNormals[0]; "
               + "PressureForce[1] = prel * nodeNormals[1]; "
               + "PressureForce[2] = prel * nodeNormals[2];"
)

# Surface output with custom field
custom_output = fl.SurfaceOutput(
    name="Custom Surface Analysis",
    entities=[volume_mesh["wing*"]],
    output_format="paraview",
    output_fields=["Cp", "PressureForce"]  # Include the custom field
)

# Include in simulation parameters
simulation_params = fl.SimulationParams(
    # ... other parameters ...
    user_defined_fields=[custom_field],
    outputs=[custom_output]
)
```
