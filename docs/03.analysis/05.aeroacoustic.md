## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Frequency Range Configuration**

The frequency range setting determines the span of frequencies included in the acoustic analysis:

- **Default range:** `10 Hz` to `10000 Hz`

>**Note:** This range is used for the analysis, not just the display.

#### **Averaging Configuration**

The averaging system allows for detailed control over how the acoustic data is processed:

- **Default segments:** `1`
- **Segmentation options:**
  - **RPM-based:** Suitable for rotating machinery analysis
  - **Time interval-based:** General purpose, with configurable time step

#### **Welch Method Settings**

It can be used for calculating spectra.

- **Segment length options:**
  - `None`: Automatic segment length determination (default)
  - `Value`: User-specified custom segment length
- **Scaling options:**
  - `Spectrum`: Power spectrum scaling (default)
  - `Density`: Power spectral density scaling
- **Averaging methods:**
  - `Mean`: Arithmetic mean across segments (default)
  - `Median`: Median value across segments

- Use A-weighting to reflect how humans perceive noise.
- Use options to improve comparison between observers and to validate results against experimental data.
- Use different types of analysis for comparison to identify potential sources of noise.
- Compare different types of analysis to qualitatively differentiate between deterministic and non-deterministic types of noise.

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **What is the recommended number of segments for averaging?**
  > The default value of 1 segment calculates the average across all segments. The number of segments for averaging should be chosen to ensure each segment contains sufficient data to resolve the highest frequency of interest for a representative, continuously averaged signal. As a guideline, the total number of data after averaging should contain at least twice the frequency of interest.

- **When should I use A-weighting?**
  > Apply A-weighting when comparing results to human perception or when meeting certification requirements that specify A-weighted sound levels.

- **What is the difference between RPM and Time interval segmentation?**
  > RPM-based segmentation is useful for rotating machinery analysis, where one revolution is used to segment unsteady data. Time-interval segmentation is more general and applicable to all unsteady simulations. Note that when using time-interval segmentation, the interval must NOT be smaller than the simulation time step.
