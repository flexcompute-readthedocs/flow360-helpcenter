# Visualization

*Flow360's visualization interface provides powerful capabilities for analyzing and understanding computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results. The interactive 3D viewer allows users to examine flow features through various visualization techniques, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulation data.*

## **Interface Overview**

| *Component* | *Description* |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Surfaces** | Setting up the contours on the geometry surfaces |
| **Slices** | Setting up the contours on the volume surfaces |
| **Isosurfaces** | Showing and coloring the predefined isosurfaces |
| **Streamlines** | Configuring streamline visibility |

## **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Surface Visualization**

*Display flow field variables on geometric surfaces of the model.*

**Available Fields:**

Selectable fields depend on the surface output configuration in simulation settings. For a complete list, refer to [surface output](../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.output-list/03.surface-output.md).

---

### **Slice Visualization**

*Create 2D cross-sectional views of the flow field for detailed examination of flow features.*

**Available Fields:**

Selectable fields depend on the slice output configuration. For a complete list, refer to [slice output](../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.output-list/05.slice-output.md).

---

### **Isosurface Visualization**

*Generate 3D surfaces of constant value for selected flow variables.*

**Available Fields:**

Selectable fields depend on the isosurface output configuration. For a complete list, refer to [isosurface output](../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.output-list/11.isosurface-output.md).

### **Streamline Visualisation**

*Show streamlines through given points.*

**Available Fields:**

Visualisation of the streamlines can be controlled through the following options:

- **Tube width:** diameter of the stream tube.
- **Point list:** list of points which define the streamlines that should be shown.
- **Solid color:** color of the streamlines 
- **Direction:** direction in which the streamlines should be generated.

## **Colormap control**

*Colormaps are color schemes used to represent different values of a flow variable.*

### **Controls**
- Range and scale customization: the scale can be chosen to be logarithmic and value ranges can be set using the slider.
- Clipping (advanced): allows for visualising only a specific range of values of the field variable.

### **Color schemes**

*By clicking on the colormap button, you will enter the colormap customization menu.*

**Scheme selection:**

The scheme can be chosen from one of the built-in ones or custom made.

**Custom scheme creation:**
- The bar at the top shows the preview of a created colormap.
- To add a step in the colormap you have to press a + icon below the preview bar.
- The first column describes the percentage of the value range of the colormap at which the defined color is placed.
- The second column opens a menu that allows for the color choice.
- The third column is the HEXHSL code of the chosen color.
- The last column is the opacity of the color.
- Checking a continuous option means that the colormap will be smooth and there will be transitions between the colors.
- Checking a discrete option means a discrete colormap with the number of colors within the range of values equal to the `Bins` parameter.

- **Surface Visualization**
  - Start with pressure coefficient (`Cp`) for quick flow behavior assessment
  - Use `yPlus` to verify mesh resolution near walls
  - Enable log scale for variables with large value ranges

- **Slice Visualization**
  - Place initial slices at key geometric features
  - Use multiple slices to track flow development
  - Compare variables on the same slice plane for correlation analysis

- **Isosurface Visualization**
  - Combine with surface visualization for comprehensive analysis

- **Why are some fields not available in my visualization?**
  > Available fields depend on the output configuration in your simulation settings. Check the corresponding output settings in your simulation configuration.

- **Can I export visualization images?**
  > Yes, either manually create a screenshot or use the report generation capability in Python API.
