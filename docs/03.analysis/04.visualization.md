# Visualization

Flow360's visualization interface provides powerful capabilities for analyzing and understanding computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results. The interactive 3D viewer allows users to examine flow features through various visualization techniques, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulation data.

### 📊 Surface Visualization

*Display flow field variables on geometric surfaces of the model.*

#### 📋 Available Fields

Selectable fields depend on the surface output configuration in simulation settings. For a complete list, refer to [surface output](../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.output-list/03.surface-output.md).

---

### 🔪 Slice Visualization

*Create 2D cross-sectional views of the flow field for detailed examination of flow features.*

#### 📋 Available Fields

Selectable fields depend on the slice output configuration. For a complete list, refer to [slice output](../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.output-list/05.slice-output.md).

---

### 🌐 Isosurface Visualization

*Generate 3D surfaces of constant value for selected flow variables.*

#### 📋 Available Fields

Selectable fields depend on the isosurface output configuration. For a complete list, refer to [isosurface output](../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.output-list/11.isosurface-output.md).

### ➰ Streamline Visualisation

*Show streamlines through given points.*

#### Available options

The visualisation of the streamlines can be controlled through the following options:

- **Tube width:** 
- **Point list:** a list of points which define the streamlines that should be shown.
- **Solid color:** the color of the streamlines 
- **Direction:** the directions in which the streamlines should be generated.

## 🎨 Colormap control

*Colormaps are color schemes used to represent different values of a flow variable.*

**Controls**
- Range and scale customization: the scale can be chosen to be logarithmic and value ranges can be set using the slider.
- Clipping (advanced): allows for visualising only a specific range of values of the field variable.

**Color schemes**
By clicking on the colormap button, you will enter the colormap customization menu. 

### Scheme selection 

The scheme can be chosen from one of the built-in ones or custom made.

#### Custom scheme creation
- The bar at the top shows the preview of a created colormap.
- To add a step in the colormap you have to press a + icon below the preview bar.
- The first column describes the percentage of the value range of the colormap at which the defined color is placed.
- The second column opens a menu that allows for the color choice.
- The third column is the HEXHSL code of thecohosen color.
- The last column is the opacity of the color.
- Checking a contiuous option means that the colormap will be smooth and there will be transitions between the colors.
- Checking a discrete option means a discrete colormap with the number of colors within the range f values equal to the `Bins` parameter.

- **Surface Visualization**
  - Start with pressure coefficient (`Cp`) for quick flow behavior assessment
  - Use `yPlus` to verify mesh resolution near walls
  - Enable log scale for variables with large value ranges

- **Slice Visualization**
  - Place initial slices at key geometric features
  - Use multiple slices to track flow development
  - Compare variables on the same slice plane for correlation analysis

- **Isosurface Visualization**
  - Combine with surface visualization for comprehensive analysis

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **Why are some fields not available in my visualization?**
  > Available fields depend on the output configuration in your simulation settings. Check the corresponding output settings in your simulation configuration.

- **Can I export visualization images?**
  > Yes, either manually create a screenshot or use the report generation capability in Python API.

Below is a Python code example showing how to download visualizations:

```python
import flow360 as fl

case = fl.Case(id="case-XXXXX") # provide a valid case id
case.wait() # wait for the case to finish running
results = case.results

# Volumes
results.volumes.to_file("volume_output")

# Slices
results.slices.to_file("slice_output")

# Surfaces
results.surfaces.to_file("surface_output")
```
