# GridSpec

Collective grid specification for all three dimensions.

## Grid Specification Along X, Y, and Z Axes

`grid_x`: Grid specification along x-axis

`grid_y`: Grid specification along y-axis

`grid_z`: Grid specification along z-axis

Default: [AutoGrid](/08.grid/02.1d%20grid%20specification/AutoGrid.html)

Options:

-   [UniformGrid](/08.grid/02.1d%20grid%20specification/UniformGrid.html)
-   [AutoGrid](/08.grid/02.1d%20grid%20specification/AutoGrid.html)
-   [CustomGrid](/08.grid/02.1d%20grid%20specification/CustomGrid.html)

## Free-Space Wavelength

`wavelength`: Free-space wavelength for automatic nonuniform grid. It can be *None* if there is at least one source in the simulation, in which case it is defined by the source central frequency. 

Type: floating-point number

-   Unit: $\mu$m
-   Constraint: greater than *0*
-   Default: *None*

## Grid Specification Override Structures

`override_structures`: A list of structures that is added on top of the simulation structures in the process of generating the grid. This can be used to refine the grid or make it coarser depending than the expected need for higher/lower resolution regions.

Options:

-   [Structure](/02.Structure.html)
