# Create Surface Mesh

## maxEdgeLength
Global maximum edge length on the surface mesh.

## curvatureResolutionAngle
This value will restrict the maximum angle between two linear segments when resolving a curve.

Reducing this value will locally refine the mesh near the high curvature regions, for example the nose of fuselage.
Typically we will set `curvatureResolutionAngle` between 10 to 15 degrees. For fine mesh, we will set it as 5 degrees.
