# Create Surface Mesh

## maxEdgeLength
Maximum length of element edge. This value will be overwritten on any face who have a different value for maxEdgeLength defined.

## curvatureResolutionAngle
This value will restrict the maximum angle between two linear segments when resolving a curve.

Reducing this value will locally refine the mesh near the high curvature regions, e.g. the nose of fuselage.
Typically we will set `curvatureResolutionAngle` between 10 to 15 degrees. For fine mesh, we will set it as 5 degrees.

## growthRate
Growth rate of anisotropic layers along the orthogonal direction of edges.
E.g. for leading edge, it controls the growth rate of anisotropic cells along the chord-wise direction.
Typically we set the growthRate as 1.2/1.16/1.13 for coarse/medium/fine mesh.

## edges
`edgeName` is the name you assigned to the edges in the csm file.

### type
There are 2 types of edges:
1. `aniso`
You will have anisotropic cells along the orthogonal direction to the selected edge.

2. `projectAnisoSpacing`
The node distribution along the edge will be updated.
The adjacent anisotropic spacing will be projected to the edge.

### method
If you set `type` as `aniso`, then you will have 3 methods to prescribe the 1st anisotropic layer:
1. `angle`
Resolves surface curvature along the orthogonal direction.
For leading edge, typically we use 1 deg for medium mesh.

2. `height`
Directly prescribe the thickness of the 1st anisotropic layer.

3. `aspectRatio`
The thickness of the 1st anisotropic layer will be automatically to ensure the max aspect ratio does not exceed the prescribed value.
Typically we set `aspectRatio` between 20 to 100.

### value
If you set `type` as `aniso`, after deciding the `method`, now you need to provide the `angle` (in degrees), `height` or `aspectRatio`.
