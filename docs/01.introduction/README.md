## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### 🖥️ **Dashboard**

*The Dashboard serves as the central hub for managing and monitoring your CFD projects in Flow360. It provides an intuitive overview of your simulations, resources, and project status.*

- **Recent Projects:** Grid view of recent CFD projects with status indicators, project details, and quick actions.
- **FlexCredits:** Displays your available computation credits.
- **Pending Resources:** Overview of computational resources in use, including running, queued, diverged, or failed jobs.
- **Start with the Example:** Quick-start option for new users with pre-prepared simulation scenarios.

### 🚀 **Starting a Project**

*This section guides you through creating a new project in Flow360, whether starting from geometry, surface mesh, or volume mesh.*

- **New Project Form:** Entry point for creating CFD simulations, allowing selection of workflow type, solver version, units, and description.
- **Creation Methods:**
  - From geometry: Upload CAD files for automated meshing.
  - From surface mesh: Use a pre-generated surface mesh.
  - From volume mesh: Use a pre-generated volume mesh.
- **Supported Formats:** ESP, EGADS, STEP, IGES, ACIS, STL, CGNS, and more.
- **Key Fields:** Project name, solver version, unit, description, and creation method.

### 🛠️ **Workbench Layout**

*The Flow360 workbench provides an interface for CFD simulations, with defined regions for setup, visualization, and analysis.*

- **Viewer Region:** Central 3D workspace for geometry, mesh, and results visualization.
- **Simulation Setup/Analysis Panel:** Control panel for all simulation parameters and settings.
- **Entities Browser:** Tools for visual representation and inspection of model and results.
- **Coordinate System:** Persistent indicator of axes orientation and view direction.
- **Top Navigation Bar:** Main navigation and tool selection area.
- **Bottom Status Bar:** Displays operation status, progress, and inspector tools.
- **Viewer Bar:** Switches between geometry, mesh, and visualization modes, also contains entity selection tools.

### 🔄 **General Workflow**

*This section outlines the systematic approach to setting up and running CFD simulations using the Flow360 GUI.*

- **Setup:** Configure simulation parameters in a top-to-bottom sequence.
- **Verify:** Use the inspector tool to check setup completeness and resolve errors.
- **Run:** Initiate the simulation, including automated meshing if starting from geometry.
- **Monitor:** Track simulation progress and analyze results in real time.
- **Visualize:** Inspect mesh and results using the interactive 3D viewer.

---

### 🌳 **Project Tree**

*The project tree is a hierarchical visualization of your CFD workflow, from geometry to results. It helps track progress and navigate between stages.*

- **Icons:** Represent geometry, surface mesh, volume mesh, case, fork, and draft states.
- **Structure:** Flexible hierarchy supporting geometry-first, surface-mesh-first, and volume-mesh-first workflows.
- **Branching:** Supports multiple branches at each level for mesh sensitivity, parameter studies, and continuation runs (forks).
- **Component Actions:** Open in workbench, create new run, interpolate, rename, view details, expand/collapse, delete.
