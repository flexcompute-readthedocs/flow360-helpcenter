# Starting Project

This document describes how to start a project in Flow360 GUI.

## 📝 **New Project Form**

*The New Project form is the entry point for creating CFD simulations in Flow360. It allows users to choose between geometry-based or mesh-based workflows.*

---

### 📋 **Available Options**

| **Option** | **Description** | **Default** |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| `Project name` | Unique identifier for your simulation project | `Untitled` |
| `Solver version` | Flow360 solver release version | Latest stable release |
| `Unit` | Physical unit for the geometry/mesh | `m` (meter) |
| `Description` | Optional project description and notes | Empty |
| `Creation method` | Method for creating the simulation (From geometry/From volume mesh) | `From geometry` |

### 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

#### `Project name`

*A unique name that identifies your simulation project in the Flow360 system.*

- **Default:** `Untitled`
- **Example:** `Wing_Analysis_M08`
- **Notes:** Choose a descriptive name that helps identify the project purpose.

#### `Solver version`

*Specifies the Flow360 solver version to be used for the simulation.*

- **Default:** Latest stable release
- **Example:** `release-24.11`
- **Notes:** It's recommended to use the latest stable release unless specific version compatibility is required.

#### `Unit`

*Defines the physical unit for interpreting mesh/geometry dimensions.*

It is important to distinguish between this `Unit` setting and the units used during simulation. This `Unit` setting only defines how to interpret and scale the input geometry or volume mesh file dimensions, while separate units assigned during the simulation setup will govern the actual physical calculations in the solver.

- **Default:** `m` (meter)
- **Example:** `inch`
- **Note:** Ensure this matches the units used in your CAD or mesh file to avoid scaling issues.

#### `Description`

*Optional field for adding project notes, objectives, or other relevant information.*

- **Default:** Empty
- **Example:** `High-lift configuration analysis at takeoff conditions`
- **Note:** Below the description field you can add tags to your project by clicking `+ Add` icon.

### 💡 **Creation Methods**

#### From Geometry

*Start a project by uploading CAD geometry files, which will be processed through Flow360's automated meshing pipeline.*

- **Supported formats:** ESP, EGADS, STEP, ACIS, AutoCAD-3D, Autodesk Inventor, CATIA V4-V6, Creo-Pro/E, I-deas, IFC, NX-Unigraphics, Parasolid, Revit, Rhino 3D, Solid Edge, SolidWorks, VDA-FS
- **Requirements:**
  - Clean, watertight geometry
  - Properly defined assemblies with all dependencies
  - Correct unit system selection

#### From Volume Mesh

*Initialize a project using a pre-generated volume mesh file.*

- **Supported formats:** UGrid, CGNS
- **Requirements:**
  - Valid 3D volume mesh
  - Correct unit system selection

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block"> ❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **What happens if my geometry has multiple parts?**
  > For assemblies, upload all required files including dependencies. The system will maintain the assembly structure.

- **Can I change the project unit after project creation?**
  > No, the project unit cannot be changed after project creation. Ensure correct units are selected initially. Keep in mind that this does not affect units assigned during simulation setup.

- **What if my CAD format is not listed?**
  > Consider converting your geometry to one of the supported formats using CAD translation software.

Below is a Python code example showing how to create a new project programmatically:

```python
import flow360 as fl

# Create a new project from geometry
geo_project = fl.Project.from_geometry("my_geometry.csm", "Project from geometry", length_unit=fl.u.m)

# Create a new project from volume mesh
vm_project = fl.Project.from_volume_mesh("my_volume_mesh.cgns", "Project from volume mesh", length_unit="cm")
```
