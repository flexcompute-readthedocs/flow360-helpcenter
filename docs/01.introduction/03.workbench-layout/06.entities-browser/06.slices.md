# Slices

*Slices are two-dimensional planes used to extract and visualize flow field data in Flow360. They are essential tools for analyzing flow characteristics at specific locations within the computational domain.*

## 📋 **Available Options**

| *Option* | *Description* |
|----------|---------------|
| **Normal** | Three-dimensional vector specifying the orientation of the slice plane |
| **Origin** | Reference point that lies on the slice plane |

## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### **Normal**

*A three-dimensional vector (X, Y, Z) that defines the direction perpendicular to the slice surface.*

- **Default:** `(0, 0, 1)`
- **Example:** `(1, 0, 0)` for a YZ plane
- **Notes:** The vector must be non-zero and will be normalized internally.

### **Origin**

*A point in 3D space (X, Y, Z) that defines where the slice plane is positioned.*

- **Default:** `(0, 0, 0)`
- **Example:** `(0, 0, 0) m`
- **Notes:** Coordinates are specified in m, cm, mm, ft or inch.

- **What flow variables can I visualize on a slice?**
  > Slices can display various quantities including pressure, temperature, velocity components, density, Mach number, and other solver-specific variables.

- **How is the data interpolated onto the slice?**
  > The flow field data is interpolated from the three-dimensional computational mesh onto the two-dimensional slice plane.

- **Does the slice resolution depend on the mesh?**
  > Yes, the resolution of the visualized data on the slice depends on the resolution of the underlying computational mesh.

```python
import flow360 as fl

# Create a slice at the wing mid-section
wing_slice = fl.Slice(
    name="wing_section",
    normal=(0, 1, 0),  # Normal in Y direction
    origin=(0, 3.5, 0) * fl.u.m
)
