# Boundaries

*Mesh boundaries are used to define the physical and mathematical conditions at the edges of the computational domain.*

Flow360 imports boundary names directly from the mesh input file and they cannot be changed.

Boundaries for a volume mesh exist within their parent [zones](./01.zones.md).

## **Types of boundary conditions**

Boundaries can be assigned one of the following [Boundary conditions](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/README.md):

- [Wall](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/01.wall.md)
- [Freestream](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/02.freestream.md)
- [Inflow](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/03.inflow.md)
- [Outflow](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/04.outflow.md)
- [Periodic](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/05.periodic.md)
- [Symmetry](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/06.symmetry.md)
- [Slip wall](/docs/02.simulation-setup/03.flow-solver/01.boundary-conditions/07.slip-wall.md)
- Interface (assigned automaticaly)

## **Boundaries in outputs**

When assigning [Surface output](../../../../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.outputs-list/03.surface-output.md) or [Surface probe output](../../../../02.simulation-setup/04.output/02.outputs-list/09.surface-probe-outputs.md), boundaries for which the output fields will be computed, have to be specified.
