# Edges

Edges are geometric entities representing line segments that form the boundaries of faces included in your model.

In Flow360, edges can be used to:

- Define specific regions for mesh refinement
- Control the growth of anisotropic layers
- Mark important geometric features like leading and trailing edges

## Edge Selection
You can select edges in the geometry editor using selection by clicking on the edge. You can adjust your selection options on the central toolbar.

## Edge Grouping

Edge grouping allows you to organize and manage edges in your geometry. You can group edges based on their attributes such as `edgeId`, `edgeName`. The attributes must be assigned in your CAD system.
