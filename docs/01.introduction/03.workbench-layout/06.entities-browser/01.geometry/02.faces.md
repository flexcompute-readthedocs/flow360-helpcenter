# Faces

This section describes how to work with faces in the Flow360 geometry editor. They are geometric entities representing surfaces that are a part of your model.

Faces in Flow360 can be used for the following things:

- Define specific regions for mesh refinement
- Specify boundary conditions
- Group important geometric features like wings of an airplane or underbody of a car.

### Face Selection
You can select faces in the geometry editor using selection by clicking on the face. You can adjust your selection options on the central toolbar.

### Grouping Faces

Face grouping allows you to organize and manage faces in your geometry. You can group edges based on their attributes such as `faceId`, `faceName`, `groupName`. The attributes must be assigned in your CAD system.
