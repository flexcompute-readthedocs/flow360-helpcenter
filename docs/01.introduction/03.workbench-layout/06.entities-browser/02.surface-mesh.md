# Surface Mesh

*The surface mesh represents the discretized object boundary.*

This section covers the fundamental aspects of surface mesh handling and its components.

A surface mesh in Flow360 consists of three-dimensional surface elements that discretize the objects surface. The mesh structure is defined by:

- [Boundaries](./03.volume-mesh/02.boundaries.md): Surfaces that define the edges of computational domains and interfaces between zones

## **Mesh Requirements**

Flynn360 volume mesher supports surface meshes with tetrahedral surface elements.
