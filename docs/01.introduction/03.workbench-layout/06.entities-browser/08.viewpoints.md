# Viewpoints

*The Viewpoints group contains the list of Viewpoints defined in the Project. Unlike most other items in the Project, Viewpoints can be created and edited even in "View only" mode.*

## **Managing Viewpoints**

You can interact with Viewpoints in the following ways:

### **Creating Viewpoints**
Click the **"+"** button to create a new viewpoint based on the current camera position and orientation in the viewer.

### **Using Viewpoints**
Click on any viewpoint in the list to apply it in the viewer, which will immediately change the camera to that stored position and orientation.

### **Modifying Viewpoints**
Use the menu next to each viewpoint for additional operations:

- **Update** - Replace the stored camera position and orientation with the current view shown in the viewer.
- **Rename** - Change the name of the viewpoint to something more descriptive.
- **Delete** - Remove the viewpoint from the project.

## **Viewpoints and Project Sharing**

Viewpoints are saved with the project, making them a useful tool for:

- Highlighting specific features of your geometry or simulation results
- Creating standardized views for comparing results across multiple simulations
- Guiding other users to important areas when sharing projects
