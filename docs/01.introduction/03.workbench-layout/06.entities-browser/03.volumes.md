# Volumes

*Volume entities in Flow360 are used to set up [volume zones](./../../02.simulation-setup/02.meshing/02.volume-zone.md), [local refinements](./../../02.simulation-setup/02.meshing/03.refinements/README.md) and [3D models](./../../02.simulation-setup/05.models/02.3d-models/README.md). Flow360 provides two primary volume primitives: boxes and cylinders.*

## 📝 **Volume Primitives**

*Volume primitives can be used individually or combined to create complex geometric configurations.*

| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| `Box` | Rectangular prism defined by center, size, and orientation |
| `Cylinder` | Cylindrical volume defined by axis, radius, and height |

---

## 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

### Box

A box is a rectangular prism defined by its center point and size (dimensions). Boxes can be oriented in three-dimensional space using one of two transformation methods.

#### 📋 **Box Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Name` | Name identifier for the box (note: names are not required to be unique) | - |
| `Center` | Three-dimensional coordinates defining the center point | length (e.g. m) |
| `Size` | Three-dimensional dimensions (length, width, height) | length (e.g. m) |

#### 📋 **Box Orientation Methods**

#### Method 1: Principal Axes

*Defines the box orientation using two orthogonal vectors. This method provides direct control over the box's principal directions.*

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Axes` | Two orthogonal vectors defining principal directions | dimensionless |

>**Notes**: 
> - Axes must be orthogonal vectors
> - First axis defines the primary direction
> - Second axis defines the secondary direction
> - Third axis is automatically computed to complete the right-handed coordinate system

#### Method 2: Axis & Angle

*Defines the box orientation using a rotation axis and angle. This method is useful when you need to rotate the box around a specific axis.*

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Rotation Axis` | Axis vector for rotation | dimensionless |
| `Rotation Angle` | Angle of rotation around the specified axis | degrees |

>**Notes**:
>  - Rotation angle is in degrees
>  - Positive angle follows right-hand rule around the rotation axis

### Cylinder

A cylinder is a three-dimensional geometric shape with a circular or oval cross-section.

#### 📋 **Cylinder Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Unit** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| `Name` | Name identifier for the cylinder (note: names are not required to be unique) | |
| `Center` | Three-dimensional coordinates defining the center point | length (e.g. m) |
| `Axis` | Axis vector defining cylinder direction | dimensionless |
| `Radius` | Distance from central axis to outer surface | length (e.g. m) |
| `Inner Radius` | Distance from central axis to inner surface | length (e.g. m) |
| `Height` | Length along central axis | length (e.g. m) |

>**Notes**: 
> - The cylinder axis defines the direction of the cylinder
> - Inner radius defaults to 0 for a full cylinder
> - Height is measured along the cylinder's central axis

- Choose volume type based on your specific needs:
  - Use Box for rectangular refinement zones
  - Use Cylinder for circular regions and rotating machinery
- Consider volume placement and orientation carefully
- Ensure proper scaling relative to your simulation domain
- Review volume overlap implications before implementation
- Toggle volume visibility by clicking the eye icon that appears when hovering over or selecting the volume

<summary><h3 style="display:inline-block">❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3></summary>

- **Can volumes overlap?**  
  > Yes, volumes can overlap, but this should be done intentionally as it may affect mesh generation and simulation results.

- **How do I create a hollow cylinder?**  
  > Set the inner radius parameter to a value greater than 0 and less than the outer radius.

- **What happens if I don't specify orientation for a box?**  
  > The box will align with the global coordinate system axes.

- **Can I use volumes for boundary conditions?**  
  > No, volumes are used for defining regions within the domain, not for boundary conditions.

- **How do I create a complex shape?**  
  > Combine multiple volumes using boolean operations or by positioning them appropriately.

Below is python code example of how to create volumes:

```python
import flow360 as fl

box = fl.Box(
    name="my_box",
    center=(0, 0, 0) * fl.u.m,
    size=(1, 1, 1) * fl.u.m,
    axis_of_rotation=(0, 1, 0),
    angle_of_rotation=30 * fl.u.deg
)

cylinder = fl.Cylinder(
    name="my_cylinder",
    center=(0, 0, 0) * fl.u.m,
    axis=(0, 1, 0),
    outer_radius=1.0 * fl.u.m,
    height=2.0 * fl.u.m
)
```
