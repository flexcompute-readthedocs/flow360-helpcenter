### 📋 **Dashboard Components**

| **Component** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `Recent` | Grid view of recent CFD projects with status indicators. |
| `FlexCredits` | Display of available computation credits. |
| `Pending resources` | Overview of computational resources in use, diverged, or failed. |
| `Start with the example` | Use a pre-prepared example to get accustomed to Flow360. |

### 🔍 **Detailed Descriptions**

#### `Recent`

*The main area displays a grid of recent project cards, showing your latest CFD simulations in chronological order.*

- **Information shown for each project:**
  - Project name and description
  - Number of surface meshes, volume meshes and cases
  - Divergence and error indicators
  - Last modification timestamp
- **New project button:**
  - Create a new project
- **Refresh button:**
  - Manually refresh all project resource statuses
  - Located next to New project button

#### `FlexCredits`

*Shows your current balance of computation credits.*

- **Balance:** Numerical value of your current FlexCredit balance.
- **Updates:** Credits are consumed based on computational resources used.

#### `Pending resources`

*Displays pending computational resources and their current status.*

- **Information Shown:**
  - Running jobs
  - Queue status
  - Errors and divergence

>**Note:** Below `Pending resources` there is a visual representation of all project's statuses called `Projects`.

#### `Start with the example`

*A quick-start option for new users to begin with Flow360.*

- **Features:**
  - Template for common simulation scenarios
  - Complete simulation setup
  - Sample geometries and volume meshes
