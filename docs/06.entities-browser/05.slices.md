# Slices

Slices are two-dimensional planes used to extract and visualize flow field data in Flow360. They are useful for analyzing flow characteristics at specific locations within the computational domain.

## Definition

A slice is defined by two essential parameters:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the slice
- **Normal**: A three-dimensional vector that specifies the orientation of the slice plane. This vector must be non-zero and represents the direction perpendicular to the slice surface.
- **Origin**: A single point that lies on the slice plane, specified in physical units (meters). This point serves as a reference location for the slice's position in the computational domain.

## Applications

Slices are particularly useful for:
- Visualizing flow field variables at specific cross-sections
- Analyzing flow patterns and structures
- Creating contour plots of pressure, temperature, or velocity fields
- Examining flow characteristics at critical locations in the domain

## Usage Guidelines

When defining slices, consider the following:
- The normal direction should be chosen to capture the most relevant flow features
- Multiple slices can be defined to create a comprehensive analysis of the flow field
- Slices can be positioned at any location within the computational domain
- The resolution of the slice data depends on the underlying mesh resolution

## Output Data

Slices can output various flow field variables including:
- Pressure
- Temperature
- Velocity components
- Density
- Mach number
- Other solver-specific variables

The data is interpolated from the three-dimensional flow field onto the two-dimensional slice plane.
