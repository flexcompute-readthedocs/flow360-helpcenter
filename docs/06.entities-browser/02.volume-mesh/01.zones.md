# Zones

Volume mesh zones define different regions within the volume mesh, each with specific physical properties and governing equations.

In Flow360 zone names are inferred directly from the volume mesh file and cannot be changed.

These zones contain within them [boundaries](./02.boundaries.md), which are used to set up the simulation.

## Types of volume mesh Zones

Zones can be assigned one of three types of [3D models](./../../02.simulation-setup/05.models/02.3d-models/README.md):

- [Rotation](./../../02.simulation-setup/05.models/02.3d-models/02.rotation.md)
- [Solid](./../../02.simulation-setup/05.models/02.3d-models/README.md#solid)
- [Porous medium](./../../02.simulation-setup/05.models/02.3d-models/05.porous-medium.md)

It is also worth noting that all zones that are not assigned as a solid zone, will be considered a [fluid](./../../02.simulation-setup/05.models/02.3d-models/01.fluid/README.md) zone.
