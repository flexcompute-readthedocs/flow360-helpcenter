# Boundaries

Volume mesh boundaries are used to define the physical and mathematical conditions at the edges of the computational domain.

Flow360 imports boundary names directly from the volume mesh input file and they cannot be changed.

Boundaries exist within their parent [zones](./01.zones.md).

## Types of volume mesh boundaries

Boundaries can be assigned one of the following [Boundary conditions](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md):

- [Wall](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#wall)
- [Freestream](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#freestream)
- [Inflow](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#inflow)
- [Outflow](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#outflow)
- [Periodic](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#periodic)
- [Symmetry](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#symmetry)
- [Slip wall](./../../05.models/01.boundary-conditions.md#slip-wall)

## Boundaries in outputs

When assigning [Surface output]() or [Surface probe output](), boundaries for which the output fields will be computed, have to be specified.
