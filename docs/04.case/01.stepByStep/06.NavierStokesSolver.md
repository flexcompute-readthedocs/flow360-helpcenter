# Navier Stokes Solver

## Tolerance (absolute) of the Navier-Stokes solver
  
This is the convergence criterion for all the nonlinear residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations. The nonlinear iterations through pseudo-time steps only complete when:
- all the convergence criteria are satisfied, including this,
- or [when the maximum number of nonlinear iterations](/04.case/01.stepByStep/05.timeStepping.html#the-maximum-number-of-nonlinear-iterations-used-to-converge-each-physical-time-step) are reached.

## Number of linear iterations within each Navier-Stokes nonlinear iteration

Each nonlinear (quasi-Newton) iteration requires solving a system of linear equations, for which we use an iterative method. This parameter specifies how many linear iterations to use when solving the system of linear equations iteratively.
  
## Kappa parameter in the MUSCL scheme for the Navier-Stokes solver

Specify a number between -1 and 0.333.  -1 is more robust and 0.333 is the least dissipative.
  
## Order of accuracy for spatial discretization of the Navier-Stokes solver

This order of accuracy is referred to the spatial discretization schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations convection terms. Specify either 1 for first-order or 2 for second-order. You should use second-order solver for an accurate flow solution. But sometimes first-order solutions are useful as initial conditions for cases that are difficult to converge.
