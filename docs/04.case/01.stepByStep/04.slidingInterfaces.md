# Sliding Interfaces

## The signed RPM for the rotation interface

The RPM (revolutions per minute) should be positive if the rotation follows the right-hand rule with respect to the axis of rotation (thumb pointing towards axis). If the rotation follows the left-hand rule, the RPM must be negative.
