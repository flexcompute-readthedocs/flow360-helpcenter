# Freestream

## Freestream density in kg/m^3

Freestream density in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3)
  
- For the US standard atmosphere, see
  [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/U.S._Standard_Atmosphere](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/U.S._Standard_Atmosphere)
    
- For the International standard atmosphere, see
  [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Standard_Atmosphere#/Description](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Standard_Atmosphere#/Description)
  where standard values at different altitudes are given.
  
- At standard sea level condition, enter *1.225*. Be sure to use the value with a unit of kg/m^3.
  
## Freestream temperature in Kelvin

Freestream temperature in Kelvin (K)
  
- For the US standard atmosphere, see 
  [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/U.S._Standard_Atmosphere](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/U.S._Standard_Atmosphere)
  
- For the International standard atmosphere, see
  [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Standard_Atmosphere#/Description](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_Standard_Atmosphere#/Description)
  where standard values at different altitudes are given.
  
- At the standard sea level condition, enter 288.15. Be sure to use the value with a unit of Kelvin (K).
  
## Freestream velocity in m/s

Freestream velocity in meters per second.
  
- The freestream velocity, $U_{\infty}$, is calculated by $U_{\infty} = Mach * C_{\infty}$,
where Mach is the freestream Mach number and $C_{\infty}$ is the freestream speed of sound.
- Be sure to specify a dimensional value with the unit of meter/second (m/s).
  
## Do you want to use the freestream velocity as the reference velocity for calculating aerodynamic coefficients?

A reference velocity, $U_{ref}$, is used to calculate aerodynamic coefficients, see examples in [refArea](/04.case/01.stepByStep.html#reference-area) and [moment length](/04.case/01.stepByStep.html#moment-length).

By default, the freestream velocity, $U_{\infty}$, is set to be the reference velocity.
Otherwise, you may enter a different value with the unit of meters per second (m/s) as your reference velocity in the field that shows up below.

## Reference velocity in m/s

The reference velocity, $U_{ref}$, is used to calculate aerodynamic coefficients.

Note that this will be tranlated into a reference Mach number, `MachRef` in the solver input JSON file, according to the following formulas:
- `Mach` $= U_{\infty} / C_{\infty}$
- `MachRef` $= U_{ref} / C_{\infty}$

Where, $C_{\infty}$ is the freestream speed of sound.
Also, when your freestream velocity is zero, i.e. $U_{\infty}==0$ m/s, you must enter a finite value for your reference velocity.
  
## Angle of Attack, alpha, in deg

The angle of attack in degrees.
The velocity components, both at boundaries and inside domain, are initialized, based on the angle of attack, $\alpha$ and the side slip angle, $\beta$, according to the following equations:

$U_X =  (freestreamVelocity / C_{\infty}) * \cos(\beta) * \cos(\alpha)$
$U_Y = -(freestreamVelocity / C_{\infty}) * \sin(\beta)$
$U_Z =  (freestreamVelocity / C_{\infty}) * \cos(\beta) * \sin(\alpha)$

Note that the velocity components on the left hand side are non-dimensional as used in Flow360 solver. $C_{\infty}$ is the freestream speed of sound. Also, for flow simulations with a freestream boundary condition, flow fields will be initialized according to this boundary condition.
  
## Angle of Sideslip, beta, in deg

The side slip angle in degrees, $\beta$. See [alpha](/04.case/01.stepByStep#angle-of-attack-alpha-in-deg).
