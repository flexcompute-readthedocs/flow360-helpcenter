# BlochBoundary

Specifies a Bloch boundary condition along a single dimension.

## Normalized Bloch Vector Component

`bloch_vec`: Normalized component of the Bloch vector in units of *2 * pi / (size along dimension)* in the background medium, along the dimension in which the boundary is specified.

Type: complex number

-   Default: *None*
