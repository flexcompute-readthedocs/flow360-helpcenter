# Volumes

Volume entities in Flow360 are used to set up [volume zones](./../02.meshing/02.volume-zone.md), [local refinements](./../02.meshing/03.refinements.md) and [3D models](./../05.models/02.3d-model.md).

Flow360 provides two primary volume primitives: boxes and cylinders. These primitives can be used individually or combined to create complex geometric configurations.

## Box

A box is a rectangular prism defined by its center point and size (dimensions). Boxes can be oriented in three-dimensional space using one of two transformation methods.

### Input Parameters

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the box
- **Center**: Three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) in meters defining the center point of the box
- **Size**: Three-dimensional dimensions (length, width, height) in meters defining the box's extent

The box can be oriented using one of the following methods:

#### Method 1: Principal Axes

- **Axes**: Two orthogonal vectors defining the principal directions of the box

#### Method 2: Axis & Angle

- **Axis of rotation**: A normalized vector (x, y, z) defining the axis around which the box will be rotated
- **Angle of rotation**: The angle in degrees specifying the amount of rotation around the defined axis

## Cylinder

A cylinder is a three-dimensional geometric shape with a circular or oval cross-section.

### Input Parameters

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the cylinder
- **Center**: Three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) in meters defining the center point of the cylinder
- **Axis**: A normalized vector (x, y, z) defining the direction of the cylinder's central axis
- **Radius**: Distance in meters from the central axis to the outer surface
- **Inner radius**: Distance in meters from the central axis to the inner surface (0 for a full cylinder)
- **Height**: Length of the cylinder in meters along its central axis

## Visibility

Volume visibility can be toggled on/off by clicking on the eye icon that appears next to it when you hover your cursor over the entity or have it selected.
