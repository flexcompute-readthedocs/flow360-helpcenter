# Monitor Outputs

Monitor outputs in Flow360 allow you to track flow field variables at specific locations during the simulation, providing real-time feedback on how your solution is developing. There are three main types of monitors:

1. **Probe Output** - Monitor points in the volume
2. **Surface Probe Output** - Monitor points projected onto surfaces
3. **Surface Integral Output** - Integrated values over surfaces

## Probe Output

Probe Output lets you monitor flow field variables at specific points or arrays of points within the computational domain.

### Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Probe Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Probe Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the probe group
- **Points**: Define one or more probe points by specifying their coordinates, or arrays of points by specifying start and end points
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to monitor

A probe point is defined by:
- **Name**: A unique identifier for the probe
- **Location**: The 3D coordinates of the probe point

A probe array is defined by:
- **Name**: A unique identifier for the array
- **Start**: The 3D coordinates of the start point
- **End**: The 3D coordinates of the end point
- **Number of Points**: How many points to place along the line (including start and end)

## Surface Probe Output

Surface Probe Output is similar to Probe Output, but the probe points are projected onto selected surfaces. This is useful for monitoring variables precisely on boundary surfaces.

### Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Surface Probe Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Surface Probe Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the surface probe group
- **Points**: Define one or more probe points by specifying their coordinates, or arrays of points by specifying start and end points
- **Target Surfaces**: Select the surfaces to project the probes onto
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to monitor

## Surface Integral Output

Surface Integral Output calculates integrated values of flow variables over selected surfaces. This is particularly useful for computing forces, moments, and other integrated quantities.

### Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Surface Integral Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Surface Integral Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the integral
- **Surfaces**: Select the surfaces to integrate over
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to integrate

## History Files

Monitor outputs generate history files that track time-series data during simulations. These files are stored in CSV format and updated throughout the simulation, allowing for real-time monitoring and post-processing.

### Types of History Files

#### Standard Monitor History Files
- Probe outputs: Records flow variables at specified points in the volume
- Surface probe outputs: Records flow variables at points projected onto surfaces
- Surface integral outputs: Records integrated forces and moments on surfaces

#### Special Purpose History Files

- **Actuator Disk Output**: Records thrust, torque, and power data for actuator disk models
  - Useful for tracking propulsion system performance over time
  - Files are named based on the specific actuator disk

- **BET Loading Output**: Records force and moment data for blade element theory models
  - Contains sectional data for each blade element
  - Useful for analyzing blade loading distributions
  - Helps identify blade sections experiencing high loads

- **Heat Transfer**: Records heat flux and temperature data
  - Tracks thermal performance over time
  - Important for cooling and thermal management analysis

### Using History Files

History files can be used for:
- Real-time monitoring of simulation progress
- Convergence assessment
- Time-series analysis
- Frequency analysis (for unsteady simulations)
- Verification and validation against experimental data

## Time-Averaged Monitor Outputs

> **Note**: Time-averaged outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping.

For unsteady simulations, you can enable time-averaging for probe and surface probe outputs to get statistical data. This is configured in the Output Settings panel by checking the time-averaging option.

## Output Format

Monitor data is typically saved in CSV format for easy plotting and analysis. The data is updated at the specified frequency during the simulation, allowing real-time monitoring of the solution progress.
