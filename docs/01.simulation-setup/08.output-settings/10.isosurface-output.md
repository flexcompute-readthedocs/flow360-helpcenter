# Isosurface Output

Isosurface Output in Flow360 lets you visualize flow field variables on surfaces of constant value within the computational domain. This is particularly useful for identifying and analyzing coherent structures like vortices, shock waves, or temperature contours.

## Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Isosurface Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Isosurface Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the output (defaults to "Isosurface output")
- **Output Format**: Choose between "paraview", "tecplot", or "both" (defaults to "paraview")
- **Isosurfaces**: Define one or more isosurfaces by specifying a field variable and iso-value
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to include in the output

### Animation Settings

- **Frequency**: How often to save outputs, in number of physical time steps (defaults to -1, which means only at the end of simulation)
- **Frequency Offset**: The time step at which to start the output animation (defaults to 0, beginning of simulation)

## Defining Isosurfaces

Each isosurface is defined by:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the isosurface
- **Field**: The flow variable used to define the isosurface
- **Iso-value**: The constant value of the field variable that defines the isosurface

## Available Isosurface Fields

Isosurfaces can be defined based on the following field variables:

- `p` - Pressure (non-dimensional)
- `rho` - Density (non-dimensional)
- `Mach` - Mach number (non-dimensional)
- `qcriterion` - Q criterion (for vortex identification) (non-dimensional)
- `s` - Entropy (non-dimensional)
- `T` - Temperature (non-dimensional)
- `Cp` - Coefficient of pressure (non-dimensional)
- `Cpt` - Total pressure coefficient (non-dimensional)
- `mut` - Turbulent viscosity (non-dimensional)
- `nuHat` - Spalart-Almaras variable (non-dimensional)
- `vorticityMagnitude` - Vorticity Magnitude (non-dimensional)

## Common Isosurface Applications

1. **Vortex Identification**: Q-criterion isosurfaces (typically positive values)
   - This is one of the most common applications of isosurfaces in Flow360
   - The default isosurface value for auto-generated Q-criterion is `RefMach² / (all walls' bounding box length)²`
   - For aircraft simulations: try `Mach² / WingSpan²`
   - For rotor flows: try `TipMach² / RotorDiameter²`
2. **Shock Wave Visualization**: Mach number or pressure gradient isosurfaces
3. **Temperature Contours**: Temperature isosurfaces for thermal analysis
4. **Separation Regions**: Skin friction or velocity isosurfaces

## Performance Considerations

- Isosurfaces are computationally efficient compared to volume outputs
- The number and complexity of isosurfaces affect computational and visualization performance
- Try to limit the number of isosurfaces in a single output
- For complex flows, consider using multiple isosurface values to capture different flow features
