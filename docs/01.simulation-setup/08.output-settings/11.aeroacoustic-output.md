# Aeroacoustic Output

Aeroacoustic Output in Flow360 enables the prediction of sound generation and propagation from aerodynamic flows. This feature is valuable for applications where noise prediction is important, such as aircraft design, wind turbine performance, and automotive aerodynamics.

> **Important**: Aeroacoustic Output is **only available for unsteady simulations** (when unsteady time stepping is selected).

## Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Aeroacoustic Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Aeroacoustic Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the output (defaults to "Aeroacoustic output")
- **Observers**: Define one or more observer positions where acoustic data will be recorded
- **Patch Type**: Choose between "solid" or "permeable" approach for aeroacoustic computation
- **Permeable Surfaces**: If using permeable patch type, specify the surfaces to use

### Observer Definition

Each observer is defined by:

- **Position**: The 3D coordinates where acoustic data will be recorded
- **Group Name**: A group identifier for the observer, useful for organizing multiple observers

## Solid vs. Permeable Approach

- **Solid**: Uses solid wall boundaries to compute the aeroacoustic solution. This is the default and simpler approach.
- **Permeable**: Uses surfaces embedded within the flow domain to capture acoustic sources. This approach can capture additional acoustic sources and is more accurate for certain applications.

## Additional Options

- **Write Per Surface Output**: When enabled, aeroacoustic results are written for each surface separately, in addition to the combined results for all surfaces. This is disabled by default.

## Aeroacoustic History Files

Aeroacoustic Output generates specialized history files containing acoustic data at each observer location:

### Time Domain Data
- Acoustic pressure time histories for each observer position
- Individual contributions from each surface (if "Write Per Surface Output" is enabled)
- Combined acoustic signals from all surfaces

### Frequency Domain Data
- Frequency spectra generated from the time domain signals
- Sound Pressure Level (SPL) data at various frequencies
- Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) values

### File Format and Organization
- CSV files for easy import into analysis software
- Time domain data is updated continuously during the simulation
- Frequency analysis is performed at the end of the simulation
- Files are organized by observer and surface groups

### Post-Processing
The acoustic history files can be used for:
- Noise source identification
- Directivity analysis
- Spectral analysis
- A-weighted sound level calculations
- Comparison with experimental measurements
- Certification requirement evaluations

## Important Considerations

1. **Observer Placement**: Observers can be placed outside the simulation domain but must not be on or inside solid surfaces.

2. **Temporal Resolution**: Aeroacoustic analysis requires sufficient temporal resolution to capture the relevant frequency content. Make sure your time step is small enough for the frequency range of interest.

3. **Spatial Resolution**: The mesh should be fine enough to resolve acoustic waves of the frequencies of interest. As a rule of thumb, aim for at least 20 grid points per wavelength of the highest frequency of interest.

4. **Simulation Duration**: The simulation must run long enough to capture the acoustic phenomena of interest, including startup transients.

5. **Permeable Surfaces**: When using the permeable approach, the permeable surfaces should enclose all significant acoustic sources and be placed in regions with good mesh resolution.

## Output Format

Aeroacoustic output includes:

- Time history of acoustic pressure signals at each observer location
- Spectral content (frequency domain) of the acoustic signals
- Overall sound pressure levels
