# Surface Slice Output

Surface Slice Output in Flow360 allows you to visualize flow field variables along the intersection lines between slice planes and selected surfaces. This is particularly useful for examining boundary layer profiles, wake structures, or flow features at specific surface locations.

## Configuration

In the **Output Settings** panel, you can create a new Surface Slice Output by clicking the **Add Output** button and selecting **Surface Slice Output**.

### Basic Settings

- **Name**: A descriptive name for the output
- **Slices**: Define one or more slice planes by specifying their origin and normal vector
- **Target Surfaces**: Select the surfaces that the slices will intersect with
- **Output Fields**: Select the flow variables to include in the output
- **Output Format**: Currently only "paraview" is supported

### Animation Settings

- **Frequency**: How often to save outputs, in number of physical time steps (defaults to -1, which means only at the end of simulation)
- **Frequency Offset**: The time step at which to start the output animation (defaults to 0, beginning of simulation)

## Defining Slices

Each slice is defined by:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the slice
- **Origin**: The 3D coordinates of a point on the slice plane
- **Normal**: The normal vector to the slice plane (does not need to be normalized)

## Available Output Fields

Surface Slice Output supports the same output fields as Surface Output:

## Applications

Surface Slice Output is particularly useful for:

1. **Airfoil Analysis**: Extract pressure and skin friction distributions at specific spanwise locations
2. **Wing-Body Junctions**: Examine flow structures at the intersection of components
3. **Wake Analysis**: Capture wake profiles at different downstream locations
4. **Boundary Layer Studies**: Extract boundary layer profiles at specific locations
5. **Heat Transfer Analysis**: Examine temperature and heat flux along specific cross-sections

## Visualization Tips

1. Combine Surface Slice Output with standard Slice Output to see both surface and volume data along the same slice plane
2. Use multiple slices to capture 3D effects (e.g., spanwise variations along a wing)
3. For rotating machinery, consider using slices aligned with the rotation axis or perpendicular to it at different radial positions

## Time-Averaged Surface Slice Output

> **Note**: Time-averaged outputs are only available when using unsteady time stepping.

For unsteady simulations, you can create time-averaged data on surface slices by enabling the time-averaging option in the Output Settings panel. This generates time-averaged values of the selected output fields.

The **Start Step** setting controls when averaging begins (defaults to automatic detection). Time-averaged outputs provide statistical data that is useful for analyzing unsteady flow features
