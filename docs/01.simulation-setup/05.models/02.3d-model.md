# 3D Model

The 3D Model section in Flow360 allows you to configure the fluid properties, solver settings, and specialized physical models for your simulation.

## Overview

In the Models section of the UI, after configuring boundary conditions, you'll set up the 3D model parameters that define the fluid behavior and any additional physical models needed for your specific application.

## Fluid

This section allows you to configure the basic fluid properties and solver settings.

> Note: Detailed documentation for the Fluid section will be provided in a future update.

## Specialized Models

Flow360 offers several specialized models to address specific physical phenomena beyond basic fluid dynamics. These models can be enabled and configured in the 3D Model section.

### Rotation

The Rotation model handles rotating reference frames for problems involving rotating machinery.

**When to Use**:
- Propellers or rotors in hover/static conditions
- Turbomachinery simulations
- Any case where parts of the domain are rotating at a constant speed

**Key Settings**:
- **Rotation Axis**: The axis around which rotation occurs
- **Rotation Center**: The point through which the rotation axis passes
- **Rotation Rate**: The angular velocity (RPM or rad/s)
- **Frame Type**:
  - **Non-Inertial Reference Frame**: The entire domain rotates (appropriate for single rotating component)
  - **Multiple Reference Frame (MRF)**: Different regions rotate at different speeds or not at all

**Best Practices**:
- Define rotation consistently with your CAD coordinate system
- For multiple rotating components, carefully define the interfaces between rotating and stationary zones
- Verify conservation across reference frame interfaces

### BET Disk (Blade Element Theory Disk)

The BET Disk model simulates the effect of rotor or propeller blades using blade element theory without requiring a detailed blade mesh.

**When to Use**:
- Helicopter rotors where detailed blade modeling is impractical
- Propellers where wake effects are important but detailed blade geometry is not
- Multi-rotor configurations where interactions between rotors are important

**Key Settings**:
- **Disk Geometry**: Center position, normal vector, radius
- **Blade Properties**: Number of blades, twist distribution, chord distribution, airfoil data
- **Operating Conditions**: Collective pitch, RPM, direction of rotation
- **Advanced Settings**: Tip loss model, hub correction, etc.

**Best Practices**:
- Define accurate airfoil polars for the blade sections
- Ensure sufficient mesh resolution in the disk region and wake
- Validate against experimental data when possible
- For preliminary design, start with simpler models before moving to BET

### Actuator Disk

The Actuator Disk model provides a simplified representation of a propulsor using a momentum source term.

**When to Use**:
- Propellers or fans where detailed blade modeling is unnecessary
- Preliminary design studies
- Cases where only the thrust and torque effects matter, not detailed wake structures

**Key Settings**:
- **Disk Geometry**: Center position, normal vector, radius
- **Performance**: Thrust coefficient or pressure jump
- **Swirl**: Whether to include swirl components (rotational momentum)

**Best Practices**:
- Use for cases where detailed blade aerodynamics aren't important
- Consider upgrading to BET Disk for more accurate wake prediction
- Ensure adequate mesh resolution around the disk

### Porous Medium

The Porous Medium model simulates flow through porous regions by adding a resistance term to the momentum equations.

**When to Use**:
- Heat exchangers or radiators
- Filters or screens
- Flow distributors
- Simplified representation of complex geometries

**Key Settings**:
- **Region Definition**: Volume where the porous medium model applies
- **Resistance Coefficients**: Inertial and viscous resistance in each direction
- **Porosity**: Volume fraction available for fluid flow

**Best Practices**:
- Base resistance coefficients on experimental data when possible
- For anisotropic media, define directional resistances appropriately
- Ensure smooth transition of mesh resolution at porous media interfaces

## Combining Specialized Models

Flow360 allows you to combine different specialized models for complex simulations:

**Example Combinations**:
- Rotation + BET Disk: For advanced rotorcraft simulations
- Multiple BET Disks: For multi-rotor configurations
- Porous Medium + Heat Transfer: For thermal systems with radiators

**Considerations When Combining Models**:
- Evaluate computational cost impact
- Ensure physical compatibility between models
- Start with simpler configurations before adding complexity
- Validate each added model individually when possible

## Performance Impact

Specialized models increase computational requirements:
- BET Disk models require additional calculations for each blade element
- Rotation models require coordinate transformations
- Porous media calculations add source terms to the equations

Balance modeling fidelity with computational resources based on your simulation goals and available computing capacity.
