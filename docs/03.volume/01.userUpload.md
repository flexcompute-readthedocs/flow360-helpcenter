# Volume Mesh Uploaded By User
(1) Both CGNS and UGRID formats are supported
(2) Both *.gz and *.bz2 compressions are supported
(3) Mesh filename cannot have spaces

## CGNS 
Both single- and multi-block are supported  

## UGIRD
(1) Both big- (*.b8.ugrid) and little- (*.lb8.ugrid) endianness are supported  
(2) If the endianness is not specified in mesh filename, then you must select one when uploading the mesh

Here is [the best practice when manually preparing the mesh](https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/flow360/en/latest/preprocessing/manualMeshing/manualMeshing.html)

## Flow360Mesh.json
In addition to the mesh file, you also need to upload a json file prescribing the the noSlipWalls and slidingInterfaces (if any)

For UGIRD file, if the noSlipWalls are patch 1, 2 and 3 then the Flow360Mesh.json should looks like this:
```
{
	"boundaries": {
		"noSlipWalls": [1,2,3]
    }
}
```
