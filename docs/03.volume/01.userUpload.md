# Volume Mesh Uploaded By User
(1) Both CGNS and UGRID formats are supported  
(2) Both *.gz and *.bz2 compressions are supported  
(3) Mesh filename cannot have spaces  
(4) Here is [the best practice when manually preparing the mesh](https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/flow360/en/latest/preprocessing/manualMeshing/manualMeshing.html)

## CGNS 
Both single- and multi-block are supported  

## UGIRD
(1) Both big- (*.b8.ugrid) and little- (*.lb8.ugrid) endianness are supported  
(2) If the endianness is not specified in the mesh filename, then you must select one when uploading the mesh

## Flow360Mesh.json
In addition to the mesh file, you also need to upload a JSON file prescribing the `noSlipWalls` and `slidingInterfaces` (if any)

For the UGIRD file, if surfaces 1, 2, and 3 are `noSlipWalls` then the `Flow360Mesh.json` should look like this:
```
{
    "boundaries": {
        "noSlipWalls": [1,2,3]
    }
}
```

For the CGNS file, consider a propeller, enclosed by a sliding interface, located in front of a fuselage, the `Flow360Mesh.json` should look like this:
```
{
    "boundaries": {
        "noSlipWalls": ["rotatingBlock/propeller"]
        "noSlipWalls": ["stationaryBlock/fuselage"]
    },
    "slidingInterfaces": [
        {
            "stationaryPatches": ["stationaryBlock/interface"],
            "rotatingPatches": ["rotatingBlock/interface"],
            "axisOfRotation": [1,0,0],
            "centerOfRotation": [0,0,0]
        }
    ]
}
```
where `rotatingBlock` and `rotatingBlock` are the names you assigned to the blocks,
whereas `propeller`, `fuselage`, and `interface` are the names you assigned to the surfaces in the meshing software.
